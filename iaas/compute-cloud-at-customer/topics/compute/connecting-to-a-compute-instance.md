# Connecting to a Compute Instance
On Compute Cloud@Customer, you can connect to a running instance by using a Secure Shell (SSH) or Remote Desktop connection the same way you connect to instances in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). 
For more information, see these sections:
  * To create an instance console connection, see [Creating an Instance Console Connection](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/compute/creating-an-instance-console-connection.htm#creating-an-instance-console-connection "On Compute Cloud@Customer, before you can connect to an instance VNC console or serial console, you need to create an instance console connection.") on Compute Cloud@Customer.
  * For connection prerequisites, connection instructions, and troubleshooting suggestions, see [Connecting to an Instance](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/accessinginstance.htm).
