# Deleting an Instance Backup
On Compute Cloud@Customer, you can use the `DELETE` API to delete exported and imported instance backups. 
The API sets the exported backup lifecycle state to ****TERMINATED**** and performs one of these actions based on the type of backup:
  * **Imported instance backups:** Deletes the instance backup.
  * **Exported instance backups:** Deletes the instance backup (source for importing) from object storage bucket


Terminated instance backups are eventually cleaned up by a background task.
