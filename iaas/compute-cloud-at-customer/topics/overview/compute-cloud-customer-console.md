# Signing in to the Compute Cloud@Customer Console
Use the Compute Cloud@Customer Console to create and manage compute, storage and other resources on a Compute Cloud@Customer infrastructure. 
The Compute Cloud@Customer Console is an intuitive, graphical interface to create and manage resources on the Compute Cloud@Customer infrastructure.
**Prerequisites**
You need to know the following Compute Cloud@Customer names and your password.
  * Infrastructure name, as provided to Oracle when setting up the infrastructure.
  * Domain name where the infrastructure's console is hosted.
  * Tenancy name for the infrastructure.
  * Your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure username and password.


  1. From a browser, enter the URL of the Compute Cloud@Customer infrastructure.
For example, `https://console.**_<ccc_name>.example.com_**`
where:
     * `**_ccc_name_** `is the Compute Cloud@Customerinfrastructure name.
     * `**_example.com_**`is the domain name.
  2. On the Select Tenancy page, enter the tenancy name for the infrastructure and then click Continue.
The Sign In page is displayed.
  3. Enter your username and password, and then click Sign In.
The dashboard is displayed.
  4. Use the navigation menu (![An image of the 3-line navigation menu.](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/images/nav-icon.png)) to access the full list of manageable resources. See [Navigating the Compute Cloud@Customer Console Dashboard](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/overview/navigating-the-dashboard.htm#navigating-the-dashboard "When you sign in to the Compute Cloud@Customer Console, the dashboard is displayed with links for common tasks, such as viewing Instances, Block Volumes, File Systems, and Virtual Cloud Networks. There are also quick action links to Create Instance, Create Virtual Cloud Network, and Create Block Volume.").


**Note**
The Compute Cloud@Customer Console provides access to the resources on the Compute Cloud@Customer hardware. You can't access your OCI tenancy using the Compute Cloud@Customer Console. 
To access your OCI tenancy, sign in to the Oracle Cloud console. See [Sign In to the OCI Console](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/GSG/Tasks/signingin.htm#Signing_In_to_the_Console).
