# Limits on Resources Provided by Compute Cloud@Customer
Review the limits on the resources provided to customers by a Compute Cloud@Customer infrastructure and request new limits.
Review the following sections:
  * [Resource Limits per Infrastructure](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/overview/resource-limits.htm#limits-on-resources__limits-per-infrastructure)
  * [Limits on Concurrent Operations](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/overview/limits-on-concurrent-operations.htm#limits-on-concurrent-operations "Find out how many concurrent operations of a specific type Compute Cloud@Customer can manage at any particular time. These limits assume that no other operations of any kind are running at the same time. When a limit is exceeded, an error with code 409 or 429 is displayed.")
  * [Identity and Access Management (IAM) Limits](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/overview/identity-and-access-management-iam-limits.htm#identity-and-access-management-iam-limits "On Compute Cloud@Customer, IAM services are provided by Oracle Cloud Infrastructure \(OCI\).")


## Resource Limits per Infrastructure ðŸ”— 
The numbers provided here apply to any Compute Cloud@Customer infrastructure, regardless of its hardware configuration.
For some services, you can request a limit increase for a particular resource. See [Creating a Support Request](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/GSG/support/create-incident.htm). To access support, sign in to the Oracle Cloud Console as described in [Sign In to the OCI Console](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/GSG/Tasks/signingin.htm#Signing_In_to_the_Console).
