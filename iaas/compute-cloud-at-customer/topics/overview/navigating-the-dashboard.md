# Navigating the Compute Cloud@Customer Console Dashboard
When you sign in to the [Compute Cloud@Customer Console](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/overview/compute-cloud-customer-console.htm#accessing-the-console "Use the Compute Cloud@Customer Console to create and manage compute, storage and other resources on a Compute Cloud@Customer infrastructure."), the dashboard is displayed with links for common tasks, such as viewing **Instances** , **Block Volumes** , **File Systems** , and **Virtual Cloud Networks**. There are also quick action links to **Create Instance** , **Create Virtual Cloud Network** , and **Create Block Volume**.
**Note**
The dashboard is static and not configurable.
The navigation menu (the three lines to the left of **Oracle Compute Cloud@Customer**) displays a list of services. When you click on a service, the submenu expands and displays the resource types for that service. When you click on a resource type, a page is displayed that contains a tabular list of resources related to that resource type. The following table provides the services and their respective resource types as they're displayed in the navigation menu.
