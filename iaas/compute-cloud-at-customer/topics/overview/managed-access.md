# Oracle Operator Access Control
Compute Cloud@Customer supports the use of Oracle Operator Access Control to manage requests for temporary access to your organization's cloud resources from OCI authorized operators.
Authorized operators need to access resources to upgrade Compute Cloud@Customer, troubleshoot or help resolve an issue. Oracle Operator Access Control provides a secure workflow through which operators request access your organization's cloud environment. 
Oracle Operator Access Control: 
  * Provides the operator temporary user credentials for a specific duration.
  * Enables you to approve or deny the access requests.
  * Specifies the access level for the representative.
  * Creates logs of all actions, providing an audit trail.
