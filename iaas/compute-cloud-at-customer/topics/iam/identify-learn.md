# IAM Overview
On Compute Cloud@Customer, the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Identity and Access Management (IAM) service lets you control who has access to the cloud resources within your tenancies.
Identity and Access Management (IAM) provides features such as authentication, single sign-on (SSO), and identity lifecycle management for Oracle Cloud.
## Where to Manage IAM ðŸ”— 
**Attention**
For Compute Cloud@Customer, IAM resources are managed in OCI within your tenancy, and synchronized to Compute Cloud@Customer every ten minutes or so. IAM resources can't be managed on the Compute Cloud@Customer infrastructure.
Manage the following features and resources in OCI using the Oracle Cloud Console, OCI CLI, and OCI API:
  * Tenancy details
  * Identity domain types
  * Compartments
  * Federated identity providers
  * Users and groups
  * Policies
  * Defined tags


The way you work with IAM in OCI depends on the type of IAM that's configured in your tenancy â€“ either with Identity Domains or without Identity Domains. For more information, see these topics:
