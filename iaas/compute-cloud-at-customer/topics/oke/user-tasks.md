# Cluster Administrator Tasks
Perform a set of tasks to create OKE clusters on Compute Cloud@Customer. 
## Prerequisites ðŸ”— 
Perform the following tasks on your local system that you use to administer OKE:
  1. Configure the OCI CLI so you can run CLI commands. See [Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/cliconcepts.htm#Command_Line_Interface_CLI). 
If you already have the OCI CLI installed, use `oci -v` to check the version. The minimum required version for using OKE is 3.15.1.
If you work in more than one tenancy, create a profile for each tenancy as described in [Creating a Profile in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure CLI Configuration File](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Functions/Tasks/functionsconfigureocicli.htm).
  2. Install the Kubernetes client command line tool, `kubectl`. See [Install kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/). 
If you already have `kubectl` installed, ensure the version is within one minor version of the Kubernetes version that you're using. See [Supported Versions of Kubernetes](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/oke/container-engine-for-kubernetes.htm#container-engine-for-kubernetes__k8s-versions).


## Cluster Administrator Workflow ðŸ”— 
Perform the tasks in the following table to configure OKE on Compute Cloud@Customer.
No. | Task | Links  
---|---|---  
1. |  **Create Network resources.** Create a VCN, subnets, internet gateway, NAT gateway, route tables, and security lists.  | [Creating OKE Network Resources](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/oke/network-resources-for-oke.htm#network-resources-for-oke "Learn about the required network resources for Kubernetes Engine \(OKE\) on Compute Cloud@Customer.")  
2. |  **Create an OKE cluster.** | [Creating an OKE Cluster](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/oke/creating-a-kubernetes-cluster.htm#creating-a-kubernetes-cluster "Learn how to create OKE Clusters on Compute Cloud@Customer.")  
3. |  **Create a Kubernetes configuration file for the cluster.** | [Creating a Kubernetes Configuration File](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/oke/creating-a-kubernetes-configuration-file.htm#creating-a-kubernetes-configuration-file "On Compute Cloud@Customer, you can set up a Kubernetes configuration file for each OKE cluster that you work with. Your Kubernetes configuration file enables you to access OKE clusters using the kubectl command and the Kubernetes Dashboard.")  
4. |  **Create a Kubernetes Dashboard.** The dashboard helps you manage the cluster and manage and troubleshoot applications running in the cluster. |  On the [Kubernetes site](https://kubernetes.io/), see [Deploy and Access the Kubernetes Dashboard](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/web-ui-dashboard/)  
5. |  **Create a worker node pool.** | [Creating an OKE Worker Node Pool](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/oke/creating-a-worker-node-pools.htm#creating-a-worker-node-pools "Learn how to create OKE worker node pools on Compute Cloud@Customer for a workload cluster.")  
6. | **Configure any registries or repositories that the worker nodes need.**  
7. |  **Create a service to expose containerized applications outside the infrastructure.** | [Exposing Containerized Applications](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/oke/exposing-containerized-applications.htm#exposing-containerized-applications "To expose an application deployment so that worker node applications can be reached from outside the Compute Cloud@Customer infrastructure, create an external load balancer. An external load balancer is a Service of type LoadBalancer. The service provides load balancing for an application that has multiple running instances.")  
8. |  **Create persistent storage for applications to use.** | [Adding Storage for Containerized Applications](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/oke/adding-storage-for-containerized-applications.htm#adding-storage-for-containerized-applications "On Compute Cloud@Customer, you can add persistent storage for use by applications on an OKE cluster node. Storage created in a container's root file system is deleted when you delete the container. For more durable storage for containerized applications, configure persistent volumes to store data outside of containers.")
