# Creating and Managing OKE Clusters
On Compute Cloud@Customer, you can create and manage OKE clusters.
A cluster includes cluster management nodes. [Creating an OKE Cluster](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/oke/creating-a-kubernetes-cluster.htm#creating-a-kubernetes-cluster "Learn how to create OKE Clusters on Compute Cloud@Customer.") describes how to recognize those management nodes in a list of instances.
Other topics in this section describe how to create a Kubernetes configuration file. You need a Kubernetes configuration file for each OKE cluster that you work with. The Kubernetes configuration file enables you to access OKE clusters using the `kubectl` command and the Kubernetes Dashboard.
The following topics describe how to manage Kubernetes clusters:
  * [Creating an OKE Cluster](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/oke/creating-a-kubernetes-cluster.htm#creating-a-kubernetes-cluster "Learn how to create OKE Clusters on Compute Cloud@Customer.")
  * [Creating a Kubernetes Configuration File](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/oke/creating-a-kubernetes-configuration-file.htm#creating-a-kubernetes-configuration-file "On Compute Cloud@Customer, you can set up a Kubernetes configuration file for each OKE cluster that you work with. Your Kubernetes configuration file enables you to access OKE clusters using the kubectl command and the Kubernetes Dashboard.")
  * [Updating an OKE Cluster](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/oke/updating-a-kubernetes-cluster.htm#updating-a-kubernetes-cluster "On Compute Cloud@Customer, when you update an OKE cluster, you can change the cluster name, Kubernetes version, and tags.")
  * [Deleting an OKE Cluster](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/oke/deleting-a-kuberenetes-cluster.htm#deleting-a-kuberenetes-cluster "On Compute Cloud@Customer, deleting an OKE cluster deletes the cluster control plane nodes, worker nodes, and node pools. Other cluster resources such as VCNs, internet gateways, NAT gateways, route tables, security lists, load balancers, and block volumes aren't deleted when you delete the cluster. Those resources must be deleted separately.")
