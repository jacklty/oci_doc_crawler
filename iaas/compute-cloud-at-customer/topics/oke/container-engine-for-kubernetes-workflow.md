# Workflow to Enable OKE
Compute Cloud@Customer has specific requirements and a workflow to enable the OKE service and to configure OKE.
First, a tenancy administrator with appropriate authorizations, enables the OKE service by creating a group, policies, and a defined tag in the OCI tenancy. See [Tenancy Administrator Tasks](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/oke/administrator-tasks.htm#administrator-tasks "Learn about the set of tasks you perform in the OCI tenancy to enable the OKE service on Compute Cloud@Customer.").
Then OKE cluster administrators perform tasks to configure the OKE service on Compute Cloud@Customer to suit their workload needs. See [Cluster Administrator Tasks](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/oke/user-tasks.htm#user-tasks "Perform a set of tasks to create OKE clusters on Compute Cloud@Customer.").
