# Adding Storage for Containerized Applications
On Compute Cloud@Customer, you can add persistent storage for use by applications on an OKE cluster node. Storage created in a container's root file system is deleted when you delete the container. For more durable storage for containerized applications, configure persistent volumes to store data outside of containers.
A persistent volume (PV) is storage that enables your data to remain intact when the containers to which the storage is connected are terminated.
A PV is a resource in the cluster. A persistent volume claim (PVC) is a request for a PV resource. A PVC is a storage request that is met by binding the PVC to a PV. A PVC provides an abstraction layer to the underlying storage.
You can provision PVCs using the following methods:
  * **Block volumes**. Attach volumes from the Compute Cloud@Customer Block Volume service. The volumes are connected to clusters created by OKE using a CSI (Container Storage Interface) volume plugin deployed on the clusters.
    * To provision a regular block volume, see [Creating Persistent Block Volume Storage](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/oke/creating-persistent-block-volume-storage.htm#creating-persistent-block-volume-storage "The Compute Cloud@Customer Block Volume service provides persistent, durable, and high-performance block storage that you can use to store data outside of containers.").
    * To provision a high performance block volume, see [Creating Persistent High Performance Block Volume Storage](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/oke/creating-persistent-high-performance-block-volume-storage.htm#creating-persistent-high-performance-block-volume-storage "This procedure creates a high performance block volume as persistent storage on Compute Cloud@Customer.").
For information about block volumes on Compute Cloud@Customer, see [Block Volume Storage](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/block/block-volume-storage.htm#block-volume-storage "On Compute Cloud@Customer, Block Volumes provide high-performance network storage capacity that supports a broad range of I/O intensive workloads.").
  * **File systems**. Mount file systems from the Compute Cloud@Customer File Storage service. The File Storage service file systems are mounted inside containers running on clusters created by OKE using a CSI volume plugin deployed on the clusters.
    * Provision a PVC on a new file system using the CSI volume plugin. Create a storage class and a PVC. The CSI volume plugin dynamically creates both a new File Storage service file system and a new persistent volume backed by the new file system. See [Creating Persistent File System Storage Using the CSI Volume Plugin](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/oke/creating-persistent-file-system-storage-using-the-csi-volume-plugin.htm#creating-persistent-file-system-storage-using-the-csi-volume-plugin "On Compute Cloud@Customer, you can provision a PVC on a new file system using the CSI volume plugin. Use the kubectl command to create the storage class and persistent volume claim. The CSI volume plugin provisions the PVC on a new file system.").
    * Provision a PVC on an existing file system. Create a file system, mount target, PV, and PVC. See [Creating Persistent File System Storage Using an Existing File System](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/oke/creating-persistent-file-system-storage.htm#creating-persistent-file-system-storage "On Compute Cloud@Customer, you can provision a PVC on an existing file system.").
For information about file systems on the Compute Cloud@Customer, see [File Storage](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/file/file-storage.htm#file-storage "On Compute Cloud@Customer, the File Storage service provides a durable, scalable, secure network file system. You can connect to a File Storage service file system from any Compute Cloud@Customer compute instance in your Virtual Cloud Network \(VCN\).").
