# Network Security Guidelines
Secure network access to your resources in Compute Cloud@Customer.
For comprehensive information about security networking, see [Securing Networking: VCN, Load Balancers, and DNS](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Security/Reference/networking_security.htm).
## Use VCN Security Features ðŸ”— 
Use security lists, network security groups, or a combination of both to control packet-level traffic in and out of the resources in your VCN. See [Configuring VCN Rules and Options](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/network/configuring-vcn-rules-and-options.htm#configuring-vcn-rules-and-options "On Compute Cloud@Customer, VCNs and their subnets have various rules and options associated with them. The main categories are the use of DHCP, route tables, and security. If you do not configure these rules and options explicitly, the system uses default values.").
When you create a subnet in a VCN, by default the subnet is considered public and internet communication is permitted. Use private subnets to host resources that don't require internet access. You can also configure a service gateway in your VCN to allow resources on a private subnet to access other cloud services. See [Service Gateways](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/network/service-gateway.htm#service-gateway "On Compute Cloud@Customer, a VCN can have only one service gateway. You create a service gateway in the context of a specific VCN, so the gateway is automatically attached to that VCN upon creation. A service gateway allows traffic to and from all subnets at the time of creation. There's no mechanism to block or disable this traffic.").
Compute Cloud@Customer has a collection of features for enforcing network access control and securing VCN traffic. These features are listed in the following table:
VCN Feature  |  Security Description  
---|---  
VCNs and Subnets  | A VCN can be partitioned into subnets. Instances inside private subnets can't have public IP addresses. Instances inside public subnets can optionally have public IP addresses at your discretion. See [Managing VCNs and Subnets](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/network/managing-vcns-and-subnets.htm#managing-vcns-and-subnets "On Compute Cloud@Customer,")  
Security Rules |  Security rules provide stateful and stateless firewall capability to control network access to your instances.  To implement security rules in your VCN, you can use Network Security Groups or Security Lists. For more information, see:
  * [Comparison of Security Lists and Network Security Groups](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm#comparison)
  * [Configuring VCN Rules and Options](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/network/configuring-vcn-rules-and-options.htm#configuring-vcn-rules-and-options "On Compute Cloud@Customer, VCNs and their subnets have various rules and options associated with them. The main categories are the use of DHCP, route tables, and security. If you do not configure these rules and options explicitly, the system uses default values.")

  
Gateways | Gateways let resources in a VCN communicate with destinations outside the VCN. The gateways include: 
  * [Internet Gateways](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/network/internet-gateway.htm#internet-gateway "On Compute Cloud@Customer, an internet gateway connects the edge of the VCN with the on-premises network. The ultimate target of the traffic routed through an internet gateway can be the internet."): For internet connectivity (for resources with public IP addresses in public subnets).
  * [NAT Gateways](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/network/nat-gateway.htm#nat-gateway "On Compute Cloud@Customer, a NAT gateway gives cloud resources without a public IP access to the on-premises network, which is an external public network from the point of view of a VCN, without exposing those resources. You create a NAT gateway in the context of a specific VCN, so the gateway is automatically attached to that VCN upon creation."): For internet connectivity without exposing the resources to incoming internet connections (for resources in private subnets).
  * [Dynamic Routing Gateways (DRGs)](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/network/dynamic-routing-gateway.htm#dynamic-routing-gateway "On Compute Cloud@Customer, a dynamic routing gateway, or DRG, provides a path for private network traffic between the VCN and an on-premises network. This traffic is routed to the data center network and on to its destination."): For connectivity to your data center network.
  * [Service Gateways](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/network/service-gateway.htm#service-gateway "On Compute Cloud@Customer, a VCN can have only one service gateway. You create a service gateway in the context of a specific VCN, so the gateway is automatically attached to that VCN upon creation. A service gateway allows traffic to and from all subnets at the time of creation. There's no mechanism to block or disable this traffic."): For private connectivity to Oracle services such as Object Storage.
  * [Local VCN Peering using Local Peering Gateways](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/localVCNpeering.htm#Local_VCN_Peering_Within_Region): For connectivity to a peered VCN in the same region.

  
VCN Route Tables | Route tables control how traffic is routed from your VCN subnets to destinations outside the VCN. Routing targets can be VCN gateways or a private IP address in the VCN. See [Working with Route Tables](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/network/working-with-route-tables.htm#working-with-route-tables "On Compute Cloud@Customer,").  
IAM Policies for Networking  |  IAM policies specify access and actions permitted by IAM groups to resources in a VCN. For example, IAM polices can give administrative privileges to network administrators who manage the VCNs, and scoped-down permissions to normal users. **Attention:** For Compute Cloud@Customer, IAM resources are managed within OCI, and synchronized to Compute Cloud@Customer. IAM resources can't be managed on the Compute Cloud@Customer infrastructure. See [IAM Policies for Networking](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/accesscontrol.htm#Policies)
