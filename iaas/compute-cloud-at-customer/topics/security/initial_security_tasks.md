Secure the rack in your data center. |  [Guidelines for Securing the Hardware](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/security/guidelines-for-securing-the-hardware.htm#secure-the-hardware "After installation of Compute Cloud@Customer, secure the hardware by restricting access to the hardware.

Secure the network. |  [Guidelines for Securing the Network](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/security/secure-the-network.htm#secure-the-network "During initialization, the core network components are integrated with your existing data center network design. Uplink ports in the Compute Cloud@Customer switches connect to your next-level data center switches to provide a redundant high-speed and high-bandwidth physical connection that carries all traffic into and out of Compute Cloud@Customer.") [Network Port and Protocol Matrix](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/security/network-port-and-protocol-matrix.htm#network-port-and-protocol-matrix "Compute Cloud@Customer requires access permissions to be granted for certain IP addresses, ports, and protocols.")
