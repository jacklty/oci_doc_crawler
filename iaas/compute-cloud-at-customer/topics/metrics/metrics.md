# Compute Cloud@Customer Metrics
You can monitor Compute Cloud@Customer infrastructure resources using metrics. Compute Cloud@Customer metrics provide you with the total and available OCPU, memory, and storage resources for the infrastructure.
The following topics describe the metrics emitted by the Compute Cloud@Customer infrastructure in the `oci_ccc` metric namespace:
  * [Viewing Compute Cloud@Customer Default Metric Charts](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/metrics/viewing-default-metrics.htm#viewing-default-metrics "You can view the default metric charts for the Compute Cloud@Customer infrastructure. The charts show metrics for total and available OCPUs, memory, and storage resources in the infrastructure.")
  * [Creating a Query with Metrics Explorer](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/metrics/creating-a-query-with-metrics-explorer.htm#creating-a-query-with-metrics-explorer "On Compute Cloud@Customer, you can create your own metric queries using Metrics Explorer.")
  * [Example of Creating an Alarm on Compute Cloud@Customer](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/metrics/example-of-an-alarm.htm#example-of-an-alarm "On Compute Cloud@Customer, you can create alarms to notify you when Compute Cloud@Customer infrastructure metrics meet specified triggers.")
  * [Compute Cloud@Customer Metrics Reference](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/metrics/metrics-reference.htm#metrics-reference "See a list of metrics emitted by Compute Cloud@Customer using the oci_ccc metric namespace.")


**Note**
The monitoring information in the topics in this section only describe the metrics for the Compute Cloud@Customer infrastructure. 
For more general information about metrics, alarms, and the Metrics Explorer for other resources such as instances, see these topics:

## Required IAM Policy ðŸ”— 
To monitor resources, you must have the required type of access in a policy written by an administrator, whether you're using the Oracle Cloud Console or the REST API with an SDK, CLI, or other tool. 
The policy must give you access to the monitoring services and the resources being monitored. For more information about user authorizations for monitoring, see [Metric Access for Groups](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Security/Reference/monitoring_security.htm#metric-groups).
