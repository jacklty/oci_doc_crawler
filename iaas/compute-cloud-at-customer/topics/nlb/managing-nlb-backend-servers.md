# Managing NLB Backend Servers
On Compute Cloud@Customer, manage the backend servers that receive incoming traffic based on the policies you specified for the backend set that contains it for the network load balancer (NLB).
When you create an NLB, you must specify the backend servers (compute instances) to include in each backend set. The NLB routes incoming traffic to these backend servers based on the policies you specified for the backend set.
For more conceptual information, see [NLB Backend Servers](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/nlb/nlb-backend-configuration.htm#nlb-backend-servers "On Compute Cloud@Customer, when creating a network load balancer \(NLB\), you must specify the backend servers to include in each backend set.").
