# Resizing Volumes
On Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, the Block Volume service lets you expand the size of block volumes and boot volumes. 
Use one of the following options to increase the size of a volume:
  * Expand an existing volume in place with online resizing.
  * Restore from a volume backup to a larger volume.
  * Clone an existing volume to a new, larger volume.
  * Expand an existing volume in place with offline resizing.


You can't decrease the size of a volume.
