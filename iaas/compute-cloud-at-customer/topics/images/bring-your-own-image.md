# Bring Your Own Image (BYOI)
On Compute Cloud@Customer, the Bring Your Own Image (BYOI) feature enables you to bring your own versions of OSs to the Compute Cloud@Customer service as long as the underlying hardware supports it.
The BYOI feature provides these benefits:
  * Enables cloud migration projects.
  * Supports both old and new OSs.
  * Encourages experimentation.
  * Increases infrastructure flexibility.


**Important**
You must comply with all licensing requirements when you upload and start instances based on OS images that you supply.
A critical part of any lift-and-shift cloud migration project is the migration of on-premises virtual machines (VMs) to the cloud. You can import your on-premises virtualized root volumes into Compute Cloud@Customer using the custom image import feature, and then create compute instances using those images. 
For a list of Oracle-tested OSs for Compute Cloud@Customer, see [Guest Operating Systems](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/overview/guest-operating-systems.htm#guest-operating-systems "On Compute Cloud@Customer, you can use choose to create instances from various images. Each image provides a particular instance guest OS. This section lists the types of guest OSs you can use.").
