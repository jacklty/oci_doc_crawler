# Images for Compute Cloud@Customer Instances
On Compute Cloud@Customer, an image is a template of a virtual hard drive. The image provides the OS and other software for a compute instance. You specify an image to use when you create a compute instance.
These are the types of images you can use to create a compute instance:
  * **Platform images:** Compute Cloud@Customer includes Oracle Linux and Oracle Solaris images. These included images are available in every compartment of every tenancy. These images don't need to be downloaded or imported to access them to create an instance. See [Compute Cloud@Customer Platform Images](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/images/using-images-provided-with-compute-cloud-at-customer.htm#using-images-provided-with-compute-cloud-at-customer "You can use the platform images that are included with Oracle Compute Cloud@Customer to create instances. You can choose from Oracle Linux and Oracle Solaris images.").
  * **Custom images:** You can create a custom image of a compute instance's boot disk and use it to create other compute instances. Instances you create from your image include the customizations, configuration, and software installed when you created the image. See [Managing Custom Images](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/images/managing-custom-images.htm#managing-custom-images "On Compute Cloud@Customer, you can edit, move, import, export, and delete custom images.").
  * **Marketplace images:** You can request access to the following Marketplace images that are tested and approved for use on Compute Cloud@Customer:
    * **Oracle Weblogic Server Enterprise Edition UCM**
This image provides binaries of the Oracle WebLogic Server and the Java Development Toolkit along with the entitlement to create Oracle WebLogic Server domains in your Compute Cloud@Customer instances.
    * **Oracle WebLogic Suite UCM**
Quickly create instances that contain the key components needed to develop, test, and deploy Java EE applications in Oracle WebLogic Server or Oracle Forms applications.
For more information, see [Marketplace Images](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/images/using-marketplace-images.htm#using-marketplace-images "Learn about Marketplace images that you can use on Compute Cloud@Customer.").
  * **Bring your own image (BYOI):** You can bring your own versions of images to the cloud as long as the underlying hardware supports it. See [Bring Your Own Image (BYOI)](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/images/bring-your-own-image.htm#bring-your-own-image "On Compute Cloud@Customer, the Bring Your Own Image \(BYOI\) feature enables you to bring your own versions of OSs to the Compute Cloud@Customer service as long as the underlying hardware supports it.").


For a list of Oracle tested OSs, see [Guest Operating Systems](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/overview/guest-operating-systems.htm#guest-operating-systems "On Compute Cloud@Customer, you can use choose to create instances from various images. Each image provides a particular instance guest OS. This section lists the types of guest OSs you can use.").
