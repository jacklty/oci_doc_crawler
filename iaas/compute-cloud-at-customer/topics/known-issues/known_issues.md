## After an API key is created or changed, the initial CLI command might fail ðŸ”—  

Details
    
When an API key is added or changed for a user, the first CLI command with the new or changed key might fail. 

Workaround
    Wait a few minutes for the new key to synchronize on the Compute Cloud@Customer infrastructure, then retry the CLI command.
## The oci ccc get infrastructure and oci ccc infrastructure update CLI commands return null for the provisioning_pin value ðŸ”—  

Details
    
When you create an infrastructure, a PIN is generated and displayed in the output. 
However, if you use the `oci ccc get infrastructure` command right after creating or updating the infrastructure, the PIN might not be returned.
This happens because the PIN isn't available to the `get` command for up to 5 minutes after creation.
Example output:
```
{
 "compartment_id": "ocid1.compartment.oc1..uniqueID",
. . .
 },
 "display_name": "C3ResourcePrincipal_infra",
 "freeform_tags": {},
 "id": "ocid1.cccinfrastructure.uniqueID",
 "lifecycle_details": null,
 "lifecycle_state": "ACTIVE",
 "provisioning_fingerprint": null,
 "provisioning_pin": null,
 "rack_inventory": {
  "capacity_storage_tray_count": null,
  "compute_node_count": null,
  "management_node_count": null,
  "performance_storage_tray_count": null,
  "serial_number": null
. . .
}
```


Workaround
    
Obtain the PIN from the `create` command, or wait 5 minutes to retrieve the PIN using the `get` command.
For more information, see the [ccc infrastructure](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/tools/oci-cli/latest/oci_cli_docs/cmdref/ccc/infrastructure.html) CLI Reference page.
## When using the ccc infrastructure list CLI command with the --compartment-id-in-subtree true option, no results are returned ðŸ”—  

Details
    
You get an empty list even though there are items in the subtree.
Example:
```
oci ccc infrastructure list --profile user1 --compartment-id-in-subtree true -c ocid1.tenancy.oc1..uniqueID
{
 "data": {
  "items": []
 }
}
```


Workaround
    
Instead of using the `--compartment-id-in-subtree` option, query each compartment directly using the `-compartment` option.
Example:
```
oci ccc infrastructure list --profile user1 -compartment ocid1.tenancy.oc1..uniqueID
{
 "data": {
  "items": [ list of compartment details ]
 }
}
```

For more information, see the [ccc infrastructure](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/tools/oci-cli/latest/oci_cli_docs/cmdref/ccc/infrastructure.html) CLI Reference page.
## Output from `oci iam user get` doesn't list user capabilities ðŸ”—  

Details
    
The output from `oci iam user get` differs between Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and Compute Cloud@Customer. The Compute Cloud@Customer output shows `null` for `capabilites` and omits the list of capabilities, as shown in the following table.
OCI Output | Compute Cloud@Customer Output

```


Workaround
    To see the list of capabilities, run the `oci iam user get` command in your OCI tenancy.
