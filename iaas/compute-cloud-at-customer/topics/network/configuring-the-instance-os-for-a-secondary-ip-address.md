# Configuring the Instance OS for a Secondary IP Address
On Compute Cloud@Customer, after you create a secondary private IP address on a VNIC, sign in to the instance to configure the instance OS to use the new IP address.
## Linux Instance OS Configuration ðŸ”— 
This configuration permits use of an IP address subnet, netmask, gateway, and DNS service that are entirely independent from the existing NIC. This configuration is persistent across reboots.
Create a new network interface configuration file to create a subinterface on the existing NIC. In this example, `ens03` is the name of the existing NIC and `ifcfg-ens3:0` is the name of the new configuration file.
  1. Create the network configuration file `ifcfg-ens3:0` in the `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/` directory to create the first sub-interface (`:0`) on the existing `ens3` NIC.
Include the following entries in `ifcfg-ens3:0`:
```
TYPE=Ethernet
BOOTPROTO=none
IPADDR=a.b.c.d
PREFIX=24
GATEWAY=
DNS=
NAME=ens3:0
DEVICE=ens3:0
```

  2. Include the appropriate `IPADDR`, `PREFIX`, `GATEWAY`, and `DNS` entries for this new sub-interface.
  3. Run the following command to start the new interface:
```
# ifup ens3:0
```

  4. Run the following command to confirm that the new interface is operational:
```
# ifconfig -a
```
