# Configuring a NAT Gateway
On Compute Cloud@Customer, you can configure NAT gateways for VCNs.
After created, the NAT Gateway is ready for the addition of route rules or security settings. Note that the name of the gateway `(natgatewayUniqueID`) is assigned automatically and not by a parameter, and that the IP address of the device is also assigned automatically. 
Avoid entering confidential information in names and tags.
  * [Console](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/network/configuring-a-nat-gateway.htm)
  * [CLI](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/network/configuring-a-nat-gateway.htm)
  * [API](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/network/configuring-a-nat-gateway.htm)


  *     1. In the [Compute Cloud@Customer Console](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/overview/compute-cloud-customer-console.htm#accessing-the-console "Use the Compute Cloud@Customer Console to create and manage compute, storage and other resources on a Compute Cloud@Customer infrastructure.") navigation menu, click **Networking** , then click **Virtual Cloud Networks**.
    2. At the top of the page, select the compartment that contains the VCN where the NAT gateway will be created.
    3. Click the name of the VCN. 
The VCN details page is displayed.
    4. Under **Resources** , click NAT Gateways.
    5. Click **Create NAT Gateway**.
    6. Enter the following information:
       * **Name:** Provide a descriptive name for the NAT gateway. Avoid entering confidential information
       * **Create in Compartment:** Select the compartment in which to create the NAT Gateway.
       * **Block Traffic** Choose whether to block traffic to this NAT Gateway.
         * **(Yes: Traffic Not Blocked)** : By default, the VCN uses the NAT gateway even if it's not configured.
         * **(No: Traffic Blocked)** : You can set the NAT gateway not see traffic until it's explicitly enabled to do so.
       * **Tagging:** (Optional) Add one or more tags to this resource. Tags can also be applied later. For more information about tagging resources, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).
    7. Click **Create NAT Gateway**.
The NAT Gateway is now ready for the addition of route rules or security settings. See [Configuring VCN Rules and Options](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/network/configuring-vcn-rules-and-options.htm#configuring-vcn-rules-and-options "On Compute Cloud@Customer, VCNs and their subnets have various rules and options associated with them. The main categories are the use of DHCP, route tables, and security. If you do not configure these rules and options explicitly, the system uses default values.").
  * Use the [oci network nat-gateway create](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/tools/oci-cli/latest/oci_cli_docs/cmdref/network/nat-gateway/create.html) command and required parameters to create a new NAT gateway for the specified VCN. You must also set up a route rule with the NAT gateway as the ruleâ€™s target.
Copy
```
oci network nat-gateway create [OPTIONS]
```

For a complete list of CLI commands, flags, and options, see the [Command Line Reference](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/tools/oci-cli/latest/oci_cli_docs/index.html).
  * Use the [CreateNatGateway](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/NatGateway/CreateNatGateway) operation to create a new NAT gateway for the specified VCN.
