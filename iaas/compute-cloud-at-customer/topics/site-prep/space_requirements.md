## Receiving Specifications ðŸ”— 
Before the Compute Cloud@Customer rack arrives, ensure that the receiving area is large enough for the package. The following are the package dimensions and weights for a rack: 
  * Shipping height: 2159 mm (85 inches) 
  * Shipping width: 1118 mm (44 inches)

If your loading dock meets the height and ramp requirements for a standard freight carrier truck, then you can use a pallet jack to unload the rack. If the loading dock does not meet the requirements, then you must provide a standard forklift or other means to unload the rack. You can also request that the rack be shipped in a truck with a lift gate. 
When the rack arrives, leave the rack in its shipping packaging until it arrives at its installation site. Use a conditioned space to remove the packaging material to reduce particles before entering the data center. The entire access route to the installation site should be free of raised-pattern flooring that can cause vibration. 
Allow enough space for unpacking the system from its shipping cartons. Ensure that there is enough clearance and clear pathways for moving the rack from the unpacking location to the installation location. The following table lists the access route requirements for the rack. 
Access Route Item  |  With Shipping Pallet  |  Without Shipping Pallet
