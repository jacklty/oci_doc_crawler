# Flooring Requirements
Review important flooring requirements before Oracle Compute Cloud@Customer arrives at your site.
Use the information in this section along with the [Flooring Checklist](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/site-prep/site-checklists.htm#site_checklists__flooring-checklist) to prepare your site.
Oracle allows the installation of the Compute Cloud@Customer rack on solid flooring and on raised flooring. 
The site floor and the optional raised flooring must be able to support the total weight of the system as specified in [Space Requirements](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/site-prep/space_requirements.htm#space-requirements "Ensure that your site meets the space requirements for each Oracle Compute Cloud@Customer rack."). 
The following table lists the floor load requirements. 
Description  |  Requirement   
---|---  
Maximum allowable weight of installed rack equipment  |  952.54 kg (2100 lbs)   
Maximum allowable weight of installed power distribution units  |  52.16 kg (115 lbs)   
Maximum dynamic load (maximum allowable weight of installed equipment including power distribution units)  |  1004.71 kg (2215 lbs)
