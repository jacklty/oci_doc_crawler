# Electrical Power Requirements
Follow these important electrical power guidelines.
Use the information in this section along with the [Electrical Power Checklist](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/site-prep/site-checklists.htm#site_checklists__electrical-checklist) to prepare your site.
## Facility Power Requirements ðŸ”— 
Electrical work and installations must comply with applicable local, state, or national electrical codes. Contact your facilities manager or qualified electrician to determine what type of power is supplied to the building. 
To prevent catastrophic failures, design the input power sources to ensure adequate power is provided to the power distribution units (PDUs). When planning for power distribution requirements, balance the power load between available AC supply branch circuits. In the United States and Canada, ensure that the overall system AC input current load doesn't exceed 80 percent of the branch circuit AC current rating. 
Provide a stable power source, such as an uninterruptable power supply (UPS) to reduce the possibility of component failures. If computer equipment is subjected to repeated power interruptions and fluctuations, then it's susceptible to a higher rate of component failure. 
PDU power cords are 4 meters (13.12 feet) long, and 1 to 1.5 meters (3.3 to 4.9 feet) of the cord will be routed within the rack cabinet. The installation site AC power receptacle must be within 2 meters (6.6 feet) of the rack. 
## **Circuit Breaker Requirements** ðŸ”— 
Use dedicated AC breaker panels for all power circuits that supply power to the rack PDUs. Electrical work and installations must comply with applicable local, state, or national electrical codes. Rack PDUs require electrical circuits to be grounded to the Earth. 
**Note**
Circuit breakers are supplied by the customer. One circuit breaker is required for each power cord.
## Grounding Guidelines ðŸ”— 
Oracle Compute Cloud@Customer racks are shipped with grounding-type power cords (three-wire). Always connect the cords to grounded power outlets. Because different grounding methods are used, depending on location, check the grounding type, and refer to documentation, such as IEC documents, for the correct grounding method. Ensure that the facility administrator or qualified electrical engineer verifies the grounding method for the building, and performs the grounding work.
