# Networking Checklist
This section helps you plan for the configuration information that's required when Oracle installs the Oracle Compute Cloud@Customer rack in your data center.
Work with your network and site administrators to plan the integration of Oracle Compute Cloud@Customer into your data center. You can choose either a dynamic network or static network configuration. This checklist contains information for both options, but you only need data for the implementation that you choose.
For more information about network requirements, see [Customer Site Network Requirements](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/site-prep/network-requirements.htm#customer-network-requirements "Review the topics in this section to prepare your network environment before the arrival of the Oracle Compute Cloud@Customer rack.").
