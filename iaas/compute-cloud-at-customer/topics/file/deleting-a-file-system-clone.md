# Deleting a File System Clone
On Compute Cloud@Customer, cloned file systems are managed; you delete a clone the same way you delete a file system. However, dependencies exist between file systems, snapshots, and clones. You can't delete any resources that have a dependency. 
See [Deleting a File System](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/file/deleting-a-file-system.htm#deleting-a-file-system "On Compute Cloud@Customer, you can delete a file system that doesn't have any dependencies.").
For details about dependencies, see [Deleting File System Resources Overview](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/file/file-storage.htm#deleting-file-system-resources-overview "On Compute Cloud@Customer, you can't delete a file system resource that has dependencies.").
