# Managing File System Snapshots
On Compute Cloud@Customer, the File Storage service supports snapshots for file system data protection.
Snapshots are a consistent, point-in-time view of your file systems. Snapshots are copy-on-write, and scoped to the entire file system. The File Storage service encrypts all file system and snapshot data at rest. You can take as many snapshots as you need. 
The snapshot is accessible at `.zfs/snapshot/` **_name_**.
