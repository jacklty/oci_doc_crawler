# Accessing a Snapshot on the Mounted File System
On Compute Cloud@Customer, when a file system snapshot is created, the snapshot is placed in the file system. If the file system is mounted in a client system, you can access the snapshot on the client system.
The snapshot is accessible in this directory path: `<mount-point>`/.zfs/snapshot/`<snapshot-name>`.
## From a UNIX OS Client ðŸ”— 
  1. Log into the instance OS that has the mounted the file system from which the snapshot was made.
  2. List the snapshots.
Syntax:
```
ls -la **_<mount-point>_**/.zfs/snapshot/
```

Example:
```
ls -la /mnt/MyMountPoint/.zfs/snapshot
total 17
dr-xr-xr-x. 4 root root 4 Sep 8 15:54 .
dr-xr-xr-x. 4 root root 4 Sep 1 17:27 ..
drwxr-xr-x. 4 root root 7 Sep 8 15:53 file-system-FS-snapshot-02
drwxr-xr-x. 4 root root 6 Sep 1 18:12 file-system-FS-snapshot-01
```

  3. Change to the directory of a snapshot.
Example:
```
cd /mnt/MyMountPoint/.zfs/snapshot/file-system-FS-snapshot-02
```

  4. List the contents of the snapshot.
```
ls -la
