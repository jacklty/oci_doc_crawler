# Managing File System Clones
On Compute Cloud@Customer, a clone is a new file system that is created based on a snapshot of an existing file system. Snapshots preserve the state of the data of a file system at a particular point in time. If you take snapshots of a file system at regular intervals, you can create clones of the file system as it existed at multiple points in its lifetime.
Cloned file systems are managed in the same way that any other file system is managed. See [Managing File Systems](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/file/managing-file-systems.htm#managing-file-systems "On Compute Cloud@Customer, a file system in the File Storage service represents a network file system that's mounted by one or more clients. File systems are associated with a single compartment. File systems must have at least one export in one mount target for any client to mount and use the file system. Data is added to a file system from the client.").
