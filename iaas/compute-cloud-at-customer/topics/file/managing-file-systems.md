# Managing File Systems
On Compute Cloud@Customer, a file system in the File Storage service represents a network file system that's mounted by one or more clients. File systems are associated with a single compartment. File systems must have at least one export in one mount target for any client to mount and use the file system. Data is added to a file system from the client.
This section describes how to manage file systems after they're created. For instructions to create a file system, see [Creating a File System, Mount Target, and Export](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/file/creating-a-file-system-mount-target-and-export.htm#creating-a-file-system-mount-target-and-export "On Compute Cloud@Customer, you can use this task flow to perform all the tasks that are required to create a file system and make it available for instances.").
