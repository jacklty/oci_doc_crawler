# Configuring VCN Security Rules for File Storage
On Compute Cloud@Customer, you can add the required rules to a preexisting security list associated with a subnet, such as the default security list that is created along with the VCN. 
For specific information about which security rules are required for the File Storage service, see [File Storage Network Ports](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/file/file-storage.htm#file-storage-network-ports "On Compute Cloud@Customer, when configuring the File Storage service, you might need to know the ports that are used for a service or protocol.").
For more information about managing VCNs and subnets, see [Managing VCNs and Subnets](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/network/managing-vcns-and-subnets.htm#managing-vcns-and-subnets "On Compute Cloud@Customer,").
