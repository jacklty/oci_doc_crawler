# Managing Upgrade Schedules
Use Upgrade Schedules to define time periods when a Compute Cloud@Customer infrastructure may be upgraded by Oracle.
Upgrade schedules consist of upgrade windows, also known as events. Use separate upgrade windows to make defining the upgrade schedule easier. An upgrade window can only be used in one upgrade schedule.
When an upgrade is available, Oracle schedules it during a suitable upgrade window.
To receive email notifications when an upgrade starts and finishes, subscribe to the Compute Cloud@Customer notification topics. See [Subscribing to Upgrade Notifications](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/site-prep/subscribe-to-the-notification-service.htm#enable-the-notification-service).
