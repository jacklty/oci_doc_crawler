#### Access Resources
[Connect to a compute instance](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/accessinginstance.htm)
[Find a volume in the instance OS](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/compute-cloud-at-customer/topics/block/find-your-volume-in-the-instance.htm#find-volume-in-the-instance "In Compute Cloud@Customer, when a block volume is initially attached to an instance, the instance sees the volume as a new disk, for example: as device /dev/sdb. This procedure describes how to list the disk devices in an instance so that you can find the volume and administer it in the OS.")
