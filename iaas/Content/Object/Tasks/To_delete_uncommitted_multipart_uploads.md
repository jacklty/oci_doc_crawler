# Deleting a Multipart Upload from Object Storage
Cancel and delete an uncommitted or failed multipart upload in Object Storage.
  * [Console](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/To_delete_uncommitted_multipart_uploads.htm)
  * [CLI](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/To_delete_uncommitted_multipart_uploads.htm)
  * [API](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/To_delete_uncommitted_multipart_uploads.htm)


  *     1. On the **Buckets** list page, select the Object Storage bucket that you want to work with. If you need help finding the list page or the Object Storage bucket, see [Listing Buckets](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/managingbuckets_topic-To_get_a_list_of_buckets_concept.htm).
    2. On the details page, select **Uncommitted Multipart Uploads**.
The **Uncommitted Multipart Uploads** list appears. All uncommitted or failed multipart uploads are listed inin a table. The **Hide uploads newer than 7 days** filter is enabled by default. Disable the filter to view the complete list.
    3. Select the uploads that you want to delete, and then select **Delete**.
To bulk delete all the uncommitted multipart uploads, select the check box in the header row to select all, and then select **Delete**.
    4. When prompted, confirm the deletion.
  * Use the [oci os multipart abort](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/tools/oci-cli/latest/oci_cli_docs/cmdref/os/multipart/abort.html) command and required parameters to cancel and delete an uncommitted or failed multipart upload in a bucket:
Command
CopyTry It
```
oci os multipart abort --bucket-name bucket_name --object-name object_name --upload-id upload_ID [OPTIONS]
```

For example:
```
oci os multipart abort --bucket-name MyBucket --object-name MyObject --upload-id 0b7abd48-9ff2-9d5f-2034-63a02fdd7afa
WARNING: Are you sure you want to permanently remove this incomplete upload? [y/N]: **y**
```

**Tip**
The CLI interface asks you to confirm the deletion request. To delete without the confirmation prompt, use the `--force` flag.
You can also create a lifecycle policy that automatically deletes uncommitted or failed multipart uploads. See [Object Lifecycle Management](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/usinglifecyclepolicies.htm#object-lifecycle "Learn how to use Object Lifecycle Management to automatically manage the archiving and deletion of objects.") for more information.
**To delete all parts of an uncommitted or failed multipart upload**

```
#!/bin/bash
BUCKET=$1
oci os multipart list --bucket-name $BUCKET | \
  jq -c '.data | map({'o': .object, 'i': ."upload-id"}) | .[]' | \
  while read JSON; do
    OBJECTNAME=$(echo $JSON | jq '.o' | sed -e 's/\"//g;')
    UPLOADID=$(echo $JSON | jq '.i' | sed -e 's/\"//g;')
    echo Removing Object name $OBJECTNAME, ID $UPLOADID
    oci os multipart abort --bucket-name $BUCKET \
        --object-name $OBJECTNAME \
        --upload-id $UPLOADID \
        --force
  done
```

You can also create a lifecycle policy that automatically deletes uncommitted or failed multipart uploads. See [Object Storage Object Lifecycle Management](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/usinglifecyclepolicies.htm#object-lifecycle "Learn how to use Object Lifecycle Management to automatically manage the archiving and deletion of objects.") for details.
For a complete list of parameters and values for CLI commands, see the [CLI Command Reference](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/tools/oci-cli/latest).
  * Run the [AbortMultipartUpload](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/objectstorage/latest/MultipartUpload/AbortMultipartUpload) operation to cancel and delete an uncommitted or failed multipart upload in a bucket.
See [Using the Multipart API](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/usingmultipartuploads_topic-Using_the_Multipart_Upload_API.htm#using_api "Learn how to run multipart uploads for a bucket using the API.") for more information.
