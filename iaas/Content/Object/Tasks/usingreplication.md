# Object Storage Replication
Learn how to manage the replication of Object Storage objects across buckets.
Replication provides protection from regional outages, aids in disaster recovery efforts, and addresses data redundancy compliance requirements. Maintaining multiple copies of data in regional locations closer to user access can also reduce latency. 
Enabling Object Storage replication requires you create a replication policy on the source bucket that identifies the region and the bucket that's the destination of the replication. After the replication policy is created, the destination bucket is read-only and updated only by replication from the source bucket. Objects uploaded to a source bucket after policy creation are asynchronously replicated to the destination bucket. Objects deleted from the source bucket after policy creation are automatically deleted from the destination bucket. Objects uploaded to a source bucket before policy creation aren't replicated.
**Note**
Replication overwrites any object in the destination bucket that has the same name as an object in the source bucket. A replicated object has the same name, metadata, ETag, and MD5 value as the object in the source bucket. The creation timestamp, modified timestamp, and archival state can be different, so these attributes aren't replicated from the source.
## Replication Tasks ðŸ”— 
You can perform the following replication tasks:
  * [Create a replication policy](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/usingreplication_topic-To_create_a_replication_policy.htm#top "Create a replication policy for an Object Storage source bucket.")
  * [List the replication policies associated with a bucket](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/usingreplication_topic-To_list_replication_policies.htm#top "View a list the replication policy for an Object Storage bucket.")
  * [Get a replication policy's details](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/usingreplication_topic-get_replication_policy.htm#top "View the details of the replication policy for an Object Storage bucket.")
  * [List the replication sources for a bucket](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/list-replication-sources.htm#top "View a list of replication sources for an Object Storage replication destination bucket.")
  * [Stop replication to the destination bucket](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/usingreplication_topic-To_stop_replication_on_the_destination_bucket_and_make_the_bucket_writable.htm#top "Stop replication to the Object Storage destination bucket and make the bucket writable.")
  * [Delete a replication policy from the source bucket](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/usingreplication_topic-To_delete_the_replication_policy_on_the_source_bucket.htm#top "Delete the replication policy for an Object Storage bucket.")


## Required IAM Policies ðŸ”— 
To use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, an administrator must be a member of a group granted security access in a **policy** by a tenancy administrator. This access is required whether you're using the Console or the REST API with an SDK, CLI, or other tool. If you get a message that you don't have permission or are unauthorized, verify with the tenancy administrator what type of access you have and which **compartment** your access works in.
If you're new to policies, see [Managing Identity Domains](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/domains/overview.htm) and [Common Policies](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/commonpolicies.htm).
**Important** Replication doesn't work if you don't authorize the Object Storage service to replicate objects on your behalf. See [Service Permissions](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/usingreplication.htm#Service) for more information.
### User Permissions ðŸ”— 
You must have the required access to both the source and destination buckets when configuring replication. You must also have permissions to manage objects in the source and destination buckets. 
For administrators:
  * You can create a policy that lets the specified IAM group manage Object Storage namespaces, buckets, and their associated objects in all compartments in the tenancy. For example, here is a simple user access policy that lets a StorageAdmins group do anything with the Object Storage service resources in the tenancy:
Copy
```
Allow group StorageAdmins to manage object-family in tenancy
```

  * Alternatively, you can create policies that reduce the scope of access. For example, you can create the policies to let the StorageAdmins group manage buckets and objects in a compartment called "ObjectStore" in the tenancy:
Copy
```
Allow group StorageAdmins to manage buckets in compartment ObjectStore
Allow group StorageAdmins to manage objects in compartment ObjectStore
```



For more information about other alternatives for writing policies, see [Details for Object Storage, Archive Storage, and Data Transfer](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/policyreference/objectstoragepolicyreference.htm).
### Service Permissions ðŸ”— 
Because Object Storage is a regional service, you must authorize the Object Storage service for each region carrying out replication on your behalf. For example, you might authorize the Object Storage service in region US East (Ashburn) to manage objects on your behalf. After you authorize the Object Storage service, you can replicate the objects in a bucket in US East (Ashburn) to a bucket in another region.
To determine the region identifier value of an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure region, see [Regions and Availability Domains](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/regions.htm). 
For administrators:
To enable replication, you must authorize the service to manage objects on your behalf: 
  * For example, here is a service access policy that lets the Object Storage service do anything with the resources in the tenancy in the US West (Phoenix) region:
Copy
```
Allow service objectstorage-us-phoenix-1 to manage object-family in tenancy
```

  * Alternatively, you can create policies that reduce the scope of access. For example, you can create a policy that lets the Object Storage service do anything with the resources in a compartment called "ObjectStore" in the US West (Phoenix) region:
Copy
```
Allow service objectstorage-us-phoenix-1 to manage object-family in compartment ObjectStore
```

  * You can also create more restrictive policies that grant the individual permissions required for replication. For example:
Copy
```
Allow service objectstorage-us-phoenix-1 to manage object-family in compartment ObjectStore where any {request.permission='BUCKET_READ', request.permission='BUCKET_UPDATE', request.permission='OBJECT_READ', request.permission='OBJECT_INSPECT', request.permission='OBJECT_CREATE', request.permission='OBJECT_OVERWRITE', request.permission='OBJECT_RESTORE', request.permission='OBJECT_DELETE'}
```



## Scope and Constraints ðŸ”— 
  * Replication policy creation doesn't automatically create a destination bucket. Create the destination bucket before creating the replication policy on the source bucket.
  * A source or destination bucket can be in the Standard ([Object Storage](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Concepts/objectstorageoverview.htm#overview "Learn how to use Object Storage to store and easily access an unlimited amount of data at low cost.")) or [Archive Storage](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Archive/Concepts/archivestorageoverview.htm) tier.
  * Maximum of one replication policy per source bucket.
  * Maximum of one source for each replication destination bucket.
  * Maximum of one destination for each replication source bucket.
  * A destination bucket can't also be a replication source. Chained replication isn't supported.
  * After the replication policy is created, the destination bucket is read-only and updated only by replication from the source bucket. Objects uploaded to the source bucket are automatically replicated to the destination bucket. Objects deleted from the source bucket are automatically deleted from the destination bucket.
  * You can't delete a replication destination bucket unless you stop replication and make the bucket writable again.
  * Replication metrics aren't currently available in the Console.


## Interaction Between Replication and Other Object Storage Features ðŸ”— 
This section describes some key things you need to know about the interaction between replication and other Object Storage features. 
### Lifecycle Management
You can combine replication with [Lifecycle Management](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/usinglifecyclepolicies.htm#object-lifecycle "Learn how to use Object Lifecycle Management to automatically manage the archiving and deletion of objects.") policies that manage the archiving and deletion of objects. Lifecycle policies must, however, honor the read-only properties of the replication destination bucket. A lifecycle policy that deletes objects from the replication destination bucket doesn't work. Carefully review and test any combination replication and lifecycle policies that you implement.
Here are examples of combination policies that might benefit you:
  * You can create a lifecycle policy on the source that deletes objects with certain file extensions after a specified number of days. The result of that deletion would also be reflected in the replication destination.
  * You can create a lifecycle policy on the destination that archives objects after a specified number of days. If you don't need immediate access to those objects, you could benefit from reduced storage costs.


### Server-Side Encryption Using Your Own Keys
Replication can't replicate objects that have been encrypted with an SSE-C key. For more information, see [Using Your Own Keys for Server-Side Encryption](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/encryption.htm#Using_Your_Own_Keys_for_ServerSide_Encryption).
## Stopping Replication ðŸ”— 
You can stop replication either the replication source or the destination.
  * To stop replication from the source, delete the replication policy. Deleting a replication policy is permanent. You can't recover a deleted policy. To replicate to that target destination again, create a new policy.
  * To stop replication from the destination, make the destination bucket writable again. When you make the bucket writable, the destination bucket no longer accepts replication requests from the source. Replication status on the source changes from active to a client error state. If you want this destination to again be the target replication destination, delete the policy on the source bucket and create a new policy.
