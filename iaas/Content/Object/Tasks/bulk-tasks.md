# Bulk Object Storage Object Tasks
Learn how to perform certain tasks for Object Storage objects in bulk.
You can use the Command Line Interface (CLI) commands to perform the following tasks for some or all files in a file system directory, or in a compartment or folder:
  * [Upload files to a bucket](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/bulk-upload-object.htm#top "Upload a group of objects from a file system to an Object Storage bucket or folder.")
  * [Download objects from a bucket to a local computer](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/bulk-download-object.htm#top "Download a group of objects from a bucket to a computer file system.")
  * [Delete objects from a bucket](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/bulk-delete-object.htm#top "Delete a group of objects in a bucket or folder.")
  * [Delete versions of objects in a bucket](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/bulk-delete-object-versions.htm#top "Delete a group of object versions in a Object Storage bucket or folder.")


Run the required CLI command and required parameters, and specify the criteria for what files are affected by the command using the optional parameters described in the CLI command page linked to the topic. These criteria can include object naming patterns and metadata.
Bulk object tasks include a Dry Run feature that lets you to generate a list of the affected objects before the task is performed.
See [Objects](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/managingobjects.htm#objects "Learn about how to manageObject Storage objects, which are files or unstructured data that you can upload to an Object Storage bucket to a compartment.") for general information on objects and how you can use and manage them.
