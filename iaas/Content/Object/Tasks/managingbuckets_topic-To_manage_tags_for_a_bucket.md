# Tagging an Object Storage Bucket
Manage the tags for an Object Storage bucket.
You can apply tags to a bucket to help you organize them according to your business needs. Apply tags at the time you create a bucket, or update the bucket with tags later. For more information about applying tags, see [Overview of Tagging](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Tagging/Concepts/taggingoverview.htm).
The following topics describe how you can apply tagging to buckets:
  * [Tagging a new bucket when you are creating it.](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/tag-bucket-create.htm#top "Add metadata to an Object Storage bucket when you first create it. This metadata enables you to define keys and values and associate them with resources.")
  * [Tagging an existing bucket when you are updating it.](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/tag-bucket-update.htm#top "Add metadata to an Object Storage bucket when you update an existing one. This metadata enables you to define keys and values and associate them with resources.")


**Note**
If you're not sure whether to apply tags, ask your administrator for guidance.
