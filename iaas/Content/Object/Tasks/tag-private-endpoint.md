# Tagging a Private Endpoint in Object Storage
Add metadata to an Object Storage private endpoint, which enables you to define keys and values and associate them with resources.
You can apply tags to your Object Storage private endpoint to help you organize them according to your business needs. Apply tags at the time you create a private endpoint, or update the private endpoint with tags later. For more information about applying tags, see [Overview of Tagging](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Tagging/Concepts/taggingoverview.htm).
The following topics describe how you can apply tagging to an Object Storage private endpoint:
  * [Tagging a private endpoint at creation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/tag-create-private-endpoint.htm#top "Add metadata to an Object Storage private endpoint when you first create it. This metadata enables you to define keys and values and associate them with resources.").
  * [Tagging a private endpoint when updating.](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/tag-update-private-endpoint.htm#top "Add metadata to an Object Storage private endpoint when you update an existing one. This metadata enables you to define keys and values and associate them with resources.")
