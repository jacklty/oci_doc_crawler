If creating a retention rule fails, the most likely cause is missing or incomplete IAM permissions. Rule creation requires the following:
  * User permissions that let you access the bucket and manage the objects in those buckets. 
  * Minimally, BUCKET_UPDATE and RETENTION_RULE_MANAGE permissions. 


Review the existing policies that grant user permissions. For more information, see [Required IAM Policies](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/usingretentionrules.htm#Permissions).

  * Minimally, BUCKET_UPDATE and RETENTION_RULE_MANAGE permissions.
