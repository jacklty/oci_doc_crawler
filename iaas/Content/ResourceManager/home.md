[Start from a resource creation page](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-stack-resource.htm#top "Populate a resource creation page in another OCI service in the Console and then use the Save as stack button to create a stack in Resource Manager.")
[Use custom providers](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/update-stack-custom-providers.htm#top "Update a stack to fetch custom providers from Object Storage buckets.")
[Upgrade a stack to a later Terraform version](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/upgradingstacks.htm#top "Upgrade a stack in Resource Manager to a later Terraform version.")
#### Store Configurations Using CI/CD
[Create a stack from Bitbucket Cloud](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-stack-bitbucket-cloud.htm#top "Create a stack in Resource Manager from a Terraform configuration stored in Bitbucket Cloud. Select a configuration source provider that specifies the Bitbucket Cloud information needed to access the configurations.")
[Create a stack from Bitbucket Server](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-stack-bitbucket-server.htm#top "Create a stack in Resource Manager from a Terraform configuration stored in Bitbucket Server. Select a configuration source provider that specifies the Bitbucket Server information needed to access the configurations.")
[Create a stack from DevOps](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-stack-devops.htm#top "Create a stack in Resource Manager from a Terraform configuration stored in DevOps.")
[Create a stack from Git](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-stack-git.htm#top "Create a stack in Resource Manager from a Terraform configuration stored in Git. Select a configuration source provider that specifies the Git information needed to access the configurations.")
