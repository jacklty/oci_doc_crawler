# Tagging a Configuration Source Provider
Add metadata to a configuration source provider in Resource Manager.
**Note** If you are not sure whether to apply tags, ask your administrator for guidance.
You can apply tags to configuration source providers to organize them according to your business needs. Apply tags at the time you create a configuration source provider, or update the configuration source provider with tags later. For more information about applying tags, see [Overview of Tagging](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Tagging/Concepts/taggingoverview.htm).
The following pages describe how you can apply tagging to configuration source providers:
  * [Tagging a Configuration Source Provider at Creation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/tag-create-csp.htm#top "Add metadata to a configuration source provider when you first create it. This metadata enables you to define keys and values and to associate them with resources.")
  * [Tagging a Configuration Source Provider When Updating](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/tag-update-csp.htm#top "Add metadata to a configuration source provider when you update it. This metadata enables you to define keys and values and to associate them with resources.")
