# Using Remote Exec
With Resource Manager, you can use Terraform's remote exec functionality to execute scripts or commands on a remote computer. You can also use this technique for other provisioners that require access to the remote resource.
For more information, see [remote-exec Provisioner (terraform.io)](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/provisioners/remote-exec).
## Before You Begin ðŸ”— 
  * The location where the script is remotely executed must be an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resource with one of the following configurations.
    * A [private endpoint](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/private-endpoints.htm#top "Create, edit, and delete private endpoints in Resource Manager."). For more information, see [Private Remote Exec](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/private-endpoints.htm#remote-exec "Access private instances with Remote Exec.").
    * A [public IP address](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/managingpublicIPs.htm) with support of remote logins.
  * On Windows, WinRM must be enabled. On Linux or Unix, SSH must be enabled.
  * A key pair used for signing API requests, with the public key uploaded to Oracle. For more information on generating and uploading keys, see [Required Keys and OCIDs](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm).


## Authenticating ðŸ”— 
We recommend using one of the following approaches, depending on whether you have access to the Vault service. For more information, see [Overview of Vault](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/KeyManagement/Concepts/keyoverview.htm).
### With Vault ðŸ”— 
First, use Vault to encrypt your private key. For more information, see [Managing Keys](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/KeyManagement/Tasks/managingkeys.htm) and [Using Master Encryption Keys](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/KeyManagement/Tasks/usingkeys.htm).
Next, provide the encrypted private key to Resource Manager. You can use the decrypt data source to decrypt it.
The following code sample demonstrates this process.
Copy
```
data "oci_kms_decrypted_data" "private_key_decrypted" {
  #Required
  ciphertext = "${file(var.encrypted_private_key_path)}"
  crypto_endpoint = "${var.decrypted_data_crypto_endpoint}"
  key_id = "${var.kms_encryption_key_id}"
}
 
 
resource "oci_core_instance" "TFInstance1" {
 availability_domain = "${lookup(data.oci_identity_availability_domains.ADs.availability_domains[var.availability_domain - 1],"name")}"
 compartment_id   = "${var.compartment_ocid}"
 display_name    = "TFInstance"
 hostname_label   = "instance3"
 shape        = "${var.instance_shape}"
 subnet_id      = "${oci_core_subnet.ExampleSubnet.id}"
 
 source_details {
  source_type = "image"
  source_id  = "${var.instance_image_ocid[var.region]}"
 }
 
 extended_metadata {
  ssh_authorized_keys = "${var.ssh_public_key}"
 }
}
 
resource "null_resource" "remote-exec" {
 depends_on = ["oci_core_instance.TFInstance1"]
 provisioner "remote-exec" {
  connection {
   agent    = false
   timeout   = "30m"
   host    = "${oci_core_instance.TFInstance1.public_ip}"
   user    = "${var.opc_user_name}"
   private_key = "${data.oci_kms_decrypted_data.test_decrypted_data.plaintext}"
  }
 
  inline = [
   "touch ~/IMadeAFile.Right.Here"
  ]
 } 
}
```

### Without Vault ðŸ”— 
If you do not have access to the Vault service, you can dynamically generate a key pair and store them in the state file.
  1. Generate a key pair using a TLS resource.
  2. When you launch the compute instance, use the public key from the TLS resource. 
  3. When you establish the SSH connection, provide the private key.


**Caution** You should not save your private key in your Terraform configuration file because that is not a secure location.
The following sample demonstrates how to use the TLS private key resource to provision a compute instance, then perform a remote execution on that instance.
Copy
```
resource "tls_private_key" "public_private_key_pair" {
 algorithm  = "RSA"
}
 
resource "oci_core_instance" "TFInstance1" {
 availability_domain = "${lookup(data.oci_identity_availability_domains.ADs.availability_domains[var.availability_domain - 1],"name")}"
 compartment_id   = "${var.compartment_ocid}"
 display_name    = "TFInstance"
 hostname_label   = "instance3"
 shape        = "${var.instance_shape}"
 subnet_id      = "${oci_core_subnet.ExampleSubnet.id}"
 
 source_details {
  source_type = "image"
  source_id  = "${var.instance_image_ocid[var.region]}"
 }
 
 extended_metadata {
  ssh_authorized_keys = "${tls_private_key.public_private_key_pair.public_key_openssh}"
 }
}
 
resource "null_resource" "remote-exec" {
 depends_on = ["oci_core_instance.TFInstance1"]
 provisioner "remote-exec" {
  connection {
   agent    = false
   timeout   = "30m"
   host    = "${oci_core_instance.TFInstance1.public_ip}"
   user    = "${var.opc_user_name}"
   private_key = "${tls_private_key.public_private_key_pair.private_key_pem}"
  }
 
  inline = [
   "touch ~/IMadeAFile.Right.Here"
  ]
 } 
}
```

### Connection Construct ðŸ”— 
This example demonstrates how to use a `connection` construct for remote exec. Terraform uses a number of defaults when connecting to a resource, but these can be overridden using a `connection` block in either a `resource` or `provisioner`. For more information, see [Provisioner Connection Settings](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/provisioners/connection).
