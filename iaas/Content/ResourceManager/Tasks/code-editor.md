# Editing a Configuration Using Code Editor
Use Code Editor to edit the Terraform configuration associated with a stack in Resource Manager.
**Note** Ensure that you have policy access to Code Editor. Code Editor uses the same IAM policies as Cloud Shell. For more information, see [Required IAM Policy (Cloud Shell)](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/devcloudshellintro.htm#Required_IAM_Policy). For more information about Code Editor features and functionality, see [Code Editor](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/code_editor_intro.htm).
In the Console, you can open a Terraform configuration from the **Stack details** page, or browse the Code Editor tree view to find the Terraform configuration that you want.
## Opening a Configuration from Stack Details ðŸ”— 
  1. On the **Stacks** list page, select the stack that you want to work with. If you need help finding the list page or the stack, see [Listing Stacks](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/list-stacks.htm#top "List stacks in Resource Manager.").
  2. Go to **Edit** and then select **Edit Terraform configuration in code editor**.
The Terraform configuration opens in Code Editor. Tree navigation on the left side of Code Editor lists the selected Terraform configuration under **RESOURCE MANAGER** , **Compartments** , the compartment name, **Stacks** , the stack name, and the name of the Terraform configuration.
  3. Edit the Terraform configuration.
  4. To save changes, go to the Code Editor tree navigation, right-click the associated stack, and select **Save changes**.
  5. To run a plan job using the changes, go to the Code Editor tree navigation, right-click the associated stack, and select the relevant option.
     * **Run Plan action on stack** (displayed for configurations stored in Git)
     * **Save changes and run Plan action** (displayed for configurations stored elsewhere)
  6. To run an apply job using the changes, go to the Code Editor tree navigation, right-click the associated stack, and select the relevant option.
     * **Run Apply action on stack** (displayed for configurations stored in Git)
     * **Save changes and run Apply action** (displayed for configurations stored elsewhere)
