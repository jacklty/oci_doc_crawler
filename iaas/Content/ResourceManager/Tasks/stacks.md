# Managing Stacks
Manage stacks in Resource Manager.
## Required IAM Policy ðŸ”— 
Use policies to grant access to stacks in Resource Manager.
To manage stacks, you must be given the required type of access in a **policy** written by an administrator, whether you're using the Console or the REST API with an SDK, CLI, or other tool. If you're new to policies, see [Getting Started with Policies](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/policiesgs/get-started-with-policies.htm) and [Common Policies](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/policiescommon/commonpolicies.htm).
Administrators: For common policies that give groups access to stacks in Resource Manager, see [Manage Stacks and Jobs (Securing Resource Manager)](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Security/Reference/resourcemanager_security.htm#iam-policies__stacks-jobs).
