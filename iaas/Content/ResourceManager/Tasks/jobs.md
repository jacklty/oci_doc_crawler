# Managing Jobs
Manage jobs in Resource Manager.
**Note** For descriptions of job types, lifecycle states, and the default retry policy, see [job](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Concepts/resourcemanager.htm#concepts__jobdefinition) in the overview page.
## Required IAM Policy ðŸ”— 
Use policies to grant access to jobs in Resource Manager.
To manage jobs, you must be given the required type of access in a **policy** written by an administrator, whether you're using the Console or the REST API with an SDK, CLI, or other tool. If you're new to policies, see [Getting Started with Policies](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/policiesgs/get-started-with-policies.htm) and [Common Policies](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/policiescommon/commonpolicies.htm).
Administrators: For common policies that give groups access to jobs in Resource Manager, see [Manage Stacks and Jobs (Securing Resource Manager)](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Security/Reference/resourcemanager_security.htm#iam-policies__stacks-jobs).

  * **Succeeded** (`SUCCEEDED`): The job has completed successfully.
  * **Canceling** (`CANCELING`): The job is being canceled; a notification has been sent, but the job has not yet stopped running.
