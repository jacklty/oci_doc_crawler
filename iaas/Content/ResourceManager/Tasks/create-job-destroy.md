# Creating a Destroy Job
Create a destroy job in Resource Manager to release (tear down) resources associated with a stack and clean up the tenancy. Released resources are eventually deleted by the related OCI service. For example, a released compute instance is eventually deleted by the OCI Compute service.
The stack's job history and state remain after running a destroy job. You can monitor the status and review the results of a destroy job by inspecting the stack's log files.
The destroy job is available when resources exist that were created by the stack. 
**Note**
We recommend running a destroy job before [deleting a stack](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/delete-stack.htm#top "Delete a stack in Resource Manager. You can't undo the deletion of a stack.") to release associated resources first. When you delete a stack, its associated state file is also deleted; therefore, you lose track of the state of its associated resources. Cleaning up resources associated with a deleted stack can be difficult without the state file, especially when those resources are spread across multiple compartments. To avoid difficult cleanup later, we recommend that you release associated resources first by running a destroy job. If the stack has no associated resources, then a destroy job isn't available. You can safely [delete](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/delete-stack.htm#top "Delete a stack in Resource Manager. You can't undo the deletion of a stack.") such a stack without concern about missing state files.
Data cannot be recovered from destroyed resources.
  * [Console](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-job-destroy.htm)
  * [CLI](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-job-destroy.htm)
  * [API](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-job-destroy.htm)


  *     1. On the **Stacks** list page, select the stack that you want to work with. If you need help finding the list page or the stack, see [Listing Stacks](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/list-stacks.htm#top "List stacks in Resource Manager.").
    2. On the stack's details page, select **Destroy**.
    3. (Optional) In the **Destroy** panel, edit the default name for the job. Avoid entering confidential information.
    4. To retrieve the latest versions available from the configured source of Terraform providers, select **Show advanced options** and select **Upgrade provider versions**.
The stack must be Terraform 0.14 or later, and if the stack is older, it must be upgraded to [use Terraform Registry](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/update-stack-tf-reg.htm#top "Update an older stack to fetch providers from Terraform Registry.").This step is required if provider versions in the Terraform configuration changed since the last time a job was run on the stack. [Dependency lock files](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/files/dependency-lock) are automatically managed for new and updated stacks. Providers are updated within the version constraints of the Terraform configuration.
    5. To generate detailed log content for debugging, select **Show advanced options** and select the log level that you want from **Detailed log level**.
For more information, see [Debugging Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/internals/debugging).
    6. To adjust the maximum number of concurrent operations as [Terraform walks the graph](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/internals/graph#walking-the-graph), select **Show advanced options** and edit the value for **Maximum number of parallel operations**. (Default: `10`.) Use this option to speed up the job.
**Note** A high value might cause throttling of resources. For example, consider a Terraform configuration that defines hundreds of compute instances. An [**Apply**](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-job-apply.htm#top "Create an apply job in Resource Manager.") job attempts to create as many instances as possible at the same time. In this example, a value of `100` might cause throttling by the Compute service.
    7. To fetch the latest state before running the job, select **Show advanced options** and select **Refresh resource states before checking for differences**.
Use this option to refresh the state first. For example, consider using this option with an [**Apply**](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-job-apply.htm#top "Create an apply job in Resource Manager.") job that you intend to run on manually updated (existing) infrastructure.
**Note** Refreshing the state can affect performance. If the configuration includes several resources, consider not using this option.
    8. (Optional) Add tags:
      1. To show tagging options, select **Show advanced options**.
      2. To add a defined tag, select the namespace and key, then enter a value.
      3. To add a free-form tag, enter a key and value.
    9. Select **Destroy**.
The destroy job is created. The new job is listed under **Jobs**.
  * Use the `oci resource-manager job create-destroy-job[](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/tools/oci-cli/latest/oci_cli_docs/cmdref/resource-manager/job/create-destroy-job.html)` command and required parameters to run a destroy job.
Copy
```
oci resource-manager job create-destroy-job [OPTIONS]
```

For a complete list of parameters and values for CLI commands, see the [Command Line Reference for Resource Manager](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/tools/oci-cli/latest/oci_cli_docs/cmdref/resource-manager.html).
  * Use the [CreateJob](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/resourcemanager/latest/Job/CreateJob) operation to create a destroy job.
For an example of the `operation` part of the request, see [CreateDestroyJobOperationDetails](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/resourcemanager/latest/datatypes/CreateDestroyJobOperationDetails).


## What's Next ðŸ”— 
After running a destroy job, get the job's details to check its status. You can optionally view the Terraform state file, view the logs, and confirm deletion of the resources. You can also re-create destroyed resources.
Monitor the job status ([lifecycle state](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/jobs.htm#lifecycle "Review possible lifecycle states for jobs.")) by [getting the job's details](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/get-job.htm#top "Get the details of a job in Resource Manager. You can view name, type, status, and other key information about jobs for a specific compartment or stack. For configurations stored in Git, job details include the relevant commit identifier."). **Succeeded** (`SUCCEEDED`) indicates that the job has completed. Depending on the complexity of the job, the operation can take some time. While the job runs, or after it finishes, you can [get the job logs content](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/get-job-logs-content.htm#top "Download console logs \(raw .txt job logs content\) for a job in Resource Manager.").
To view the Terraform state file (shows the state of your resources after running the job), select the name of the job to display the **Job details** page, then select **View state** under **Resources**. Optionally select **Show changes in this version**.
To view the logs for the job, select the job to open its details page, then select **Logs** under **Resources**.
To confirm deletion of the resources, [inspect resources in the compartment](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/inspect-resources.htm#top "Inspecting resources in a compartment allows you to confirm existence of a resource that you provisioned \(by running an apply job\) or absence of a resource that you released \(by running a destroy job\)."). 
To re-create a stack's resources after the resources are destroyed, [run an apply job](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-job-apply.htm#top "Create an apply job in Resource Manager."). The new resources differ from previously destroyed resources by their unique [OCIDs](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) and other metadata.
