# Tagging a Private Template
Add metadata to a private template in Resource Manager.
**Note** If you are not sure whether to apply tags, ask your administrator for guidance.
You can apply tags to private templates to organize them according to your business needs. Apply tags at the time you create a private template, or update the private template with tags later. For more information about applying tags, see [Overview of Tagging](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Tagging/Concepts/taggingoverview.htm).
The following pages describe how you can apply tagging to private templates:
  * [Tagging a Private Template at Creation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/tag-create-template.htm#top "Add metadata to a private template when you first create it. This metadata enables you to define keys and values and to associate them with resources.")
  * [Tagging a Private Template When Updating](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/tag-update-template.htm#top "Add metadata to a private template when you update it. This metadata enables you to define keys and values and to associate them with resources.")
