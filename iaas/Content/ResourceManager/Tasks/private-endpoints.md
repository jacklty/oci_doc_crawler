# Managing Private Endpoints
Create, edit, and delete private endpoints in Resource Manager.
With private endpoints, you can access nonpublic cloud resources in your tenancy from Resource Manager. For example, configure a private compute instance using Terraform's remote exec functionality and access Terraform configurations in a private GitHub server.
You can perform the following tasks with private endpoints:
  * [Creating a Private Endpoint](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-private-endpoints.htm#top "Create a private endpoint in Resource Manager.")
  * [Listing Private Endpoints](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/list-private-endpoints.htm#top "List private endpoints in Resource Manager.")
  * [Getting a Private Endpoint's Details](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/get-private-endpoints.htm#top "Get details for a private endpoint in Resource Manager.")
  * [Getting the Reachable IP Address for a Private Endpoint](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/get-private-endpoint-reachable-ip.htm#top "Get the reachable IP address of a private endpoint in Resource Manager.")
  * [Updating a Private Endpoint](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/update-private-endpoints.htm#top "Update a private endpoint in Resource Manager.")
  * [Moving a Private Endpoint to a Different Compartment](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/move-private-endpoints.htm#top "Move a Resource Manager private endpoint to another compartment.")
  * [Deleting a Private Endpoint](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/delete-private-endpoints.htm#top "Delete a Resource Manager private endpoint.")


## Required IAM Policy ðŸ”— 
To manage private endpoints, you must have permission to manage private endpoints in the tenancy, and to use virtual network resources, such as VCNs and subnets. For more information, see [Manage Private Templates](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Security/Reference/resourcemanager_security.htm#iam-policies__templates).
If you're new to policies, see [How Policies Work](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/policieshow/Policy_Basics.htm). 
## Scenarios ðŸ”— 
Review common scenarios for using private endpoints with Resource Manager.
Other scenarios also exist. You can reach any private resource with a private IP, using a private endpoint in Resource Manager. For example, connect to a [Kubernetes cluster](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/ContEng/home.htm).
### Private Git Server ðŸ”— 
Give Resource Manager access to a Git server that isn't accessible over the internet. User these instructions for a private server that you host at Oracle Cloud Infrastructure or on-premises.
  1. If the private server is on-premises, then set up site-to-site VPN or FastConnect.
For more information, see [Site-to-Site VPN](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/managingIPsec.htm) and [FastConnect](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnect.htm).
  2. Import the private Git server's associated SSL certificate into the Certificates service.
For more information, see the relevant page:
     * [**Bitbucket Server** prerequisites](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-csp-bb-server.htm#prereqs)
     * [GitHub](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-csp-github.htm#import-cert "To access a private GitHub server, make its associated SSL certificate available in the OCI Certificates service.")
     * [GitLab](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-csp-gitlab.htm#import-cert "To access a private GitLab server, make its associated SSL certificate available in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Certificates service.")
  3. [Create a private endpoint.](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-private-endpoints.htm#top "Create a private endpoint in Resource Manager.")
  4. [Get the reachable IP address for the private endpoint.](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/get-private-endpoint-reachable-ip.htm#top "Get the reachable IP address of a private endpoint in Resource Manager.")
  5. [Create a configuration source provider](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-csp.htm#top "Create a configuration source provider in Resource Manager.") that references this private endpoint (and the associated SSL certificate that you imported into the Certificates service).
  6. [Create a stack that references this configuration source provider.](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-stack-git.htm#top "Create a stack in Resource Manager from a Terraform configuration stored in Git. Select a configuration source provider that specifies the Git information needed to access the configurations.")


### Private Remote Exec ðŸ”— 
Access private instances with Remote Exec.
**Note** When accessing a private instance with Remote Exec, you must use a reachable IP address.
See also [Getting the Reachable IP Address for a Private Endpoint](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/get-private-endpoint-reachable-ip.htm#top "Get the reachable IP address of a private endpoint in Resource Manager.").
  1. Write a Terraform configuration that creates a private instance.
  2. In the Terraform configuration, either create or reference a private endpoint:
     * [Add code to your Terraform configuration to create the private endpoint.](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-private-endpoints.htm#tf-config-create "Create a private endpoint by using a Terraform configuration.")
**Note** You can also create a private endpoint using the Console, SDK, CLI, or API. See [Creating a Private Endpoint](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-private-endpoints.htm#top "Create a private endpoint in Resource Manager.").
     * [Add code to your Terraform configuration to reference an existing private endpoint.](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/get-private-endpoints.htm#tf-config-ref "Get details for an existing private endpoint by adding code to reference it from a Terraform configuration.")
For example Terraform configurations that use Resource Manager private endpoints, see [Private endpoint Terraform configuration examples](https://github.com/oracle/terraform-provider-oci/tree/master/examples/resourcemanager).
  3. Add code to your Terraform configuration to convert the private IP address to a reachable IP address.
The reachable IP address is in the range 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255 [(Class E; see RFC 1112, Section 4)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1112).
To get the reachable IP address, see [Getting the Reachable IP Address for a Private Endpoint](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/get-private-endpoint-reachable-ip.htm#top "Get the reachable IP address of a private endpoint in Resource Manager.").
[Example code](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/private-endpoints.htm)
```
resource "null_resource" "remote-exec" {
 depends_on = [oci_core_instance.private_endpoint_instance]
 provisioner "remote-exec" {
  connection {
   agent = false
   timeout = "30m"
   host = data.oci_resourcemanager_private_endpoint_reachable_ip.test_private_endpoint_reachable_ips.ip_address
   user = "opc"
   private_key = tls_private_key.public_private_key_pair.private_key_pem
  }
  inline = [
   "echo 'remote exec showcase' > ~/remoteExecTest.txt"
  ]
 }
}
```

For example Terraform configurations that use Resource Manager private endpoints, see [Private endpoint Terraform configuration examples](https://github.com/oracle/terraform-provider-oci/tree/master/examples/resourcemanager).
  4. Store the Terraform configuration in a [supported location](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Concepts/terraformconfigresourcemanager.htm#sources).
  5. [Create a stack](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-stack.htm#top "Create a stack in Resource Manager. You can optionally postpone variables and other stack settings until after the stack is created.") that references this Terraform configuration.
  6. [Run an apply job](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-job-apply.htm#top "Create an apply job in Resource Manager.") on the stack.
The private instance and private endpoint are created. You can now use [Remote Exec](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/usingremoteexec.htm#top "With Resource Manager, you can use Terraform's remote exec functionality to execute scripts or commands on a remote computer. You can also use this technique for other provisioners that require access to the remote resource.") to access your private instance.
