# Editing a Configuration Using Visual Studio Code
Work with stacks and Terraform configurations in Visual Studio Code using the **OCI Resource Manager** extension for VS Code.
**OCI Resource Manager** is an extension of [**OCI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code**](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/vscode_plugins_intro.htm).
## Prerequisites ðŸ”— 
Either install [**OCI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code**](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/vscode_plugins_intro.htm) or install both [**OCI Toolkit Core**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Oracle.oci-core) and **OCI Resource Manager**.
As with any Oracle client, obtain an API signing key. For guidance, see [Generating an API Signing Key (Console)](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm#apisigningkey_topic_How_to_Generate_an_API_Signing_Key_Console).
## Installing the Extension ðŸ”— 
For instructions on installing the **OCI Resource Manager** extension for VS Code, see the following.
  * [Visual Studio Code Plugin for Resource Manager (Visual Studio | Marketplace)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Oracle.rms)
  * [Visual Studio Code Plugin for Resource Manager (GitHub)](https://github.com/oracle-samples/oci-vscode-toolkit)


## Listing Stacks ðŸ”— 
In the tree navigation on the left side, expand the node for the compartment that you want.
## Opening a Terraform Configuration for Editing ðŸ”— 
  1. In the tree navigation on the left side, expand the node for the compartment that you want.
  2. Expand the node for the stack that you want.
  3. Double-click the node for the Terraform configuration that you want.
The Terraform configuration file opens.


## Saving Changes ðŸ”— 
  1. In the tree navigation on the left side, expand the node for the compartment that you want.
  2. Right-click the stack that you want, and then select **Save changes**.
If the configuration is stored in Git, then a prompt for using the Git command line appears. If the configuration is stored outside Git, then a prompt appears for overwriting the existing file.
  3. Follow the prompts.


## Running the Plan Action ðŸ”— 
**Note** You can run the plan action on a stack outside Visual Studio Code. See [Creating a Plan Job](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-job-plan.htm#top "Create a plan job in Resource Manager.") and [Editing a Configuration Using Code Editor](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/code-editor.htm#top "Use Code Editor to edit the Terraform configuration associated with a stack in Resource Manager.").
  1. In the tree navigation on the left side, expand the node for the compartment that you want.
  2. Right-click the stack that you want, and then select the relevant option.
     * **Run Plan action on stack** (displayed if the configuration is stored in Git)
     * **Save changes and run Plan action on stack** (displayed if the configuration is stored elsewhere; for example, locally, or in an Object Storage bucket)
The status of the action is shown on the lower right corner. If the configuration is stored outside Git, then you are prompted to accept overwriting the existing file.
  3. Follow the prompts.

You can go to the Console to check status. Monitor the job status ([lifecycle state](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/jobs.htm#lifecycle "Review possible lifecycle states for jobs.")) by [getting the job's details](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/get-job.htm#top "Get the details of a job in Resource Manager. You can view name, type, status, and other key information about jobs for a specific compartment or stack. For configurations stored in Git, job details include the relevant commit identifier."). **Succeeded** (`SUCCEEDED`) indicates that the job has completed. Depending on the complexity of the job, the operation can take some time. While the job runs, or after it finishes, you can [get the job logs content](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/get-job-logs-content.htm#top "Download console logs \(raw .txt job logs content\) for a job in Resource Manager.").
## Running the Apply Action ðŸ”— 
**Note** You can run the apply action on a stack outside Visual Studio Code. See [Creating an Apply Job](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-job-apply.htm#top "Create an apply job in Resource Manager.") and [Editing a Configuration Using Code Editor](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/code-editor.htm#top "Use Code Editor to edit the Terraform configuration associated with a stack in Resource Manager.").
  1. In the tree navigation on the left side, expand the node for the compartment that you want.
  2. Right-click the stack that you want, and then select the relevant option.
     * **Run Apply action on stack** (displayed if the configuration is stored in Git)
     * **Save changes and run Apply action on stack** (displayed if the configuration is stored elsewhere; for example, locally, or in an Object Storage bucket)
The status of the action is shown on the lower right corner. If the configuration is stored outside Git, then a prompt appears for overwriting the existing file.
  3. Follow the prompts.


## Downloading the Terraform Configuration ðŸ”— 
  1. In the tree navigation on the left side, expand the node for the compartment that you want.
  2. Right-click the stack that you want, and then select **Download configuration**.
If the configuration is stored in Git, then a prompt for the Git URL appears at the top of the window, followed by prompts for credentials. If the configuration is stored outside Git, then a prompt might appear for overwriting the existing file.
  3. Follow the prompts.
