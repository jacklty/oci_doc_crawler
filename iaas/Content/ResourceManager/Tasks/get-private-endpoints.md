# Getting a Private Endpoint's Details
Get details for a private endpoint in Resource Manager.
## Using a Terraform Configuration ðŸ”— 
Get details for an existing private endpoint by adding code to reference it from a Terraform configuration.
For an example, see [Example Usage (Data Source: oci_resourcemanager_private_endpoint)](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/oracle/oci/latest/docs/data-sources/resourcemanager_private_endpoint#example-usage).
**Tip**
  * To create a stack that retrieves a Resource Manager private endpoint, use the **Resource Manager get private endpoint** [template](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Reference/templates.htm#top "Review the Oracle-provided templates available for Resource Manager. A template is a prebuilt Terraform configuration for deploying cloud resources in a common scenario.").
  * For example Terraform configurations that use Resource Manager private endpoints, see [Private endpoint Terraform configuration examples](https://github.com/oracle/terraform-provider-oci/tree/master/examples/resourcemanager).


  * [Console](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/get-private-endpoints.htm)
  * [CLI](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/get-private-endpoints.htm)
  * [API](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/get-private-endpoints.htm)


  * To get details for a private endpoint by using the Console, follow these steps.
On the **Private endpoints** list page, select the private endpoint that you want to work with.
