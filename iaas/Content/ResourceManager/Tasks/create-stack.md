# Creating a Stack
Create a stack in Resource Manager. You can optionally postpone variables and other stack settings until after the stack is created.
You can create stacks in the following ways:
  * [Creating a Stack from Bitbucket Cloud](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-stack-bitbucket-cloud.htm#top "Create a stack in Resource Manager from a Terraform configuration stored in Bitbucket Cloud.
