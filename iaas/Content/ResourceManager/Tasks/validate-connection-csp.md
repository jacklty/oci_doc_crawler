# Validating the Connection for a Configuration Source Provider
Confirm that Resource Manager can access a configuration source provider's server URL with the provided authentication information. You can validate a connection by using the Console only.
  1. On the **Configuration source providers** list page, select the configuration source provider that you want to work with. If you need help finding the list page or the configuration source provider, see [Listing Configuration Source Providers](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/list-csp.htm#top "List configuration source providers in Resource Manager.").
  2. Next to **Server URL** , select **Validate connection**.

A message appears indicating whether Resource Manager can access the server URL using the provided authentication information. For troubleshooting information, see [Can't Connect to Bitbucket Server](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Troubleshoot/bitbucket-cant-connect.htm#top "Troubleshoot connection issues to Bitbucket servers while working with Resource Manager.") and [Can't Connect to Git](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Troubleshoot/git-cant-connect.htm#top "Troubleshoot connection issues to Git servers while working with Resource Manager.").
