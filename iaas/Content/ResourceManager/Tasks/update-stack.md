Update a stack in Resource Manager.
[Updating a Stack (Any Type)](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/update-stack-any-type.htm#top "Update a stack in Resource Manager. This page provides the basic steps for updating a stack.") provides the basic steps. The following pages describe specific ways to update stacks:
  * [Updating a Stack's Terraform Configuration (Zip File or Folder)](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/update-stack-tf-config.htm#top "Update the zip file or folder Terraform configuration used by a stack in Resource Manager. The updated configuration is used when you run jobs on the stack. A folder-based update is available using the Console only.")
  * [Updating the Bitbucket Cloud Configuration Source Provider for a Stack](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/update-stack-csp-bitbucket-cloud.htm#top "Update the Bitbucket Cloud configuration source provider used by a stack in Resource Manager. The updated configuration source provider is used when you run jobs on the stack.")
  * [Updating the Bitbucket Server Configuration Source Provider for a Stack](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/update-stack-csp-bitbucket-server.htm#top "Update the Bitbucket Server configuration source provider used by a stack in Resource Manager. The updated configuration source provider is used when you run jobs on the stack.")
  * [Updating the Bucket for a Stack](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/update-stack-bucket.htm#top "Update the Object Storage bucket used by a stack in Resource Manager. The updated bucket is used when you run jobs on the stack.")
  * [Updating the DevOps Location for a Stack](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/update-stack-devops.htm#top "Update the DevOps repository or other location details used by a stack in Resource Manager. The updated location is used when you run jobs on the stack.")
  * [Updating the Git Configuration Source Provider for a Stack](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/update-stack-csp.htm#top "Update the Git configuration source provider used by a stack in Resource Manager. The updated configuration source provider is used when you run jobs on the stack.")
  * [Updating Variables for a Stack](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/update-stack-vars.htm#top "Update the variable values used by a stack in Resource Manager.")
  * [Using Custom Providers with a Stack](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/update-stack-custom-providers.htm#top "Update a stack to fetch custom providers from Object Storage buckets.")
  * [Using Terraform Registry with an Older Stack](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/update-stack-tf-reg.htm#top "Update an older stack to fetch providers from Terraform Registry.")


**Tip** After updating a stack, run a plan job and then get the job logs. Monitor the job status ([lifecycle state](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/jobs.htm#lifecycle "Review possible lifecycle states for jobs.")) by [getting the job's details](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/get-job.htm#top "Get the details of a job in Resource Manager. You can view name, type, status, and other key information about jobs for a specific compartment or stack. For configurations stored in Git, job details include the relevant commit identifier."). **Succeeded** (`SUCCEEDED`) indicates that the job has completed. Depending on the complexity of the job, the operation can take some time. While the job runs, or after it finishes, you can [get the job logs content](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/get-job-logs-content.htm#top "Download console logs \(raw .txt job logs content\) for a job in Resource Manager.").
