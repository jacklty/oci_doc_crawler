# Creating an Apply Rollback Job
Create an apply rollback job in Resource Manager.
When you create (run) an apply rollback job for a stack, Terraform provisions the resources and executes the action defined in the target job's Terraform configuration, applying the execution plan to the associated stack. This job rolls back your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources to a previous state.
We recommend [creating (running) a plan rollback job](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-job-plan-rollback.htm#top "Create a plan rollback job in Resource Manager.") (generating an execution plan) before running an apply rollback job, using the following flow.
  1. Identify the successful apply job that you want to roll back to.
The job you want to roll back to is also known as the "target job."
  2. [Create a plan rollback job](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-job-plan-rollback.htm#top "Create a plan rollback job in Resource Manager.") for the target job.
  3. Confirm that the plan rollback job succeeded.
  4. Confirm that the generated execution plan meets expectations.
  5. Create an apply rollback job using the generated execution plan (`executionPlanRollbackStrategy`).
Instructions are on this page.


  * [Console](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-job-apply-rollback.htm)
  * [CLI](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-job-apply-rollback.htm)
  * [API](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-job-apply-rollback.htm)


  *     1. On the **Stacks** list page, select the stack that you want to work with. If you need help finding the list page or the stack, see [Listing Stacks](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/list-stacks.htm#top "List stacks in Resource Manager.").
    2. In the **Jobs** list, find the job that you want to use for creating an apply rollback job.
You can choose a [plan rollback job](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-job-plan-rollback.htm#top "Create a plan rollback job in Resource Manager.") (recommended) or an [apply job](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-job-apply.htm#top "Create an apply job in Resource Manager.").
    3. From the Actions menu (![Actions Menu](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/libraries/global-images/actions-menu.png)) for the job, select **Rollback**.
The **Rollback** panel opens, showing the OCID and name of the selected job. **Execution plan rollback strategy** is automatically selected based on the selected job you're using for the apply rollback job: **Use execution plan from plan rollback job** for a [plan rollback job](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-job-plan-rollback.htm#top "Create a plan rollback job in Resource Manager.") and **Automatically approve** for an [apply job](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-job-apply.htm#top "Create an apply job in Resource Manager."). For more information about **Automatically approve** , see [Auto-Approve Option for Terraform Apply Command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/apply#auto-approve)
    4. For **Rollback job type** , select **Apply** to create an apply rollback job.
    5. (Optional) Edit the default name for the rollback job. Avoid entering confidential information.
    6. To generate detailed log content for debugging, select **Show advanced options** and select the log level that you want from **Detailed log level**.
For more information, see [Debugging Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/internals/debugging).
    7. To adjust the maximum number of concurrent operations as [Terraform walks the graph](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/internals/graph#walking-the-graph), select **Show advanced options** and edit the value for **Maximum number of parallel operations**. (Default: `10`.) Use this option to speed up the job.
**Note** A high value might cause throttling of resources. For example, consider a Terraform configuration that defines hundreds of compute instances. An [**Apply**](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-job-apply.htm#top "Create an apply job in Resource Manager.") job attempts to create as many instances as possible at the same time. In this example, a value of `100` might cause throttling by the Compute service.
    8. To fetch the latest state before running the job, select **Show advanced options** and select **Refresh resource states before checking for differences**.
Use this option to refresh the state first. For example, consider using this option with an [**Apply**](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-job-apply.htm#top "Create an apply job in Resource Manager.") job that you intend to run on manually updated (existing) infrastructure.
**Note** Refreshing the state can affect performance. If the configuration includes several resources, consider not using this option.
    9. (Optional) Add tags:
      1. To show tagging options, select **Show advanced options**.
      2. To add a defined tag, select the namespace and key, then enter a value.
      3. To add a free-form tag, enter a key and value.
    10. Select **Ok**.
The apply rollback job is created. The new job is listed under **Jobs**.
  * Use the `oci resource-manager job create-apply-rollback-job[](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/tools/oci-cli/latest/oci_cli_docs/cmdref/resource-manager/job/create-apply-rollback-job.html)` command and required parameters to run an apply rollback job.
Copy
```
oci resource-manager job create-apply-rollback-job --stack-id <stack_OCID> --execution-plan-rollback-strategy <source_of_execution_plan>
```

For a complete list of parameters and values for CLI commands, see the [Command Line Reference for Resource Manager](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/tools/oci-cli/latest/oci_cli_docs/cmdref/resource-manager.html).
  * Use the [CreateJob](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/resourcemanager/latest/Job/CreateJob) operation to create an apply rollback job.
For examples of details for an apply rollback job, see [ApplyRollbackJobOperationDetails](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/resourcemanager/latest/datatypes/ApplyRollbackJobOperationDetails).


## What's Next ðŸ”— 
Depending on the number and type of resources specified, a given apply rollback job can take some time.
After running an apply rollback job, get the job's details to check its status. You can optionally view the Terraform state file, view the logs, and confirm existence of provisioned resources.
Monitor the job status ([lifecycle state](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/jobs.htm#lifecycle "Review possible lifecycle states for jobs.")) by [getting the job's details](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/get-job.htm#top "Get the details of a job in Resource Manager. You can view name, type, status, and other key information about jobs for a specific compartment or stack. For configurations stored in Git, job details include the relevant commit identifier."). **Succeeded** (`SUCCEEDED`) indicates that the job has completed. Depending on the complexity of the job, the operation can take some time. While the job runs, or after it finishes, you can [get the job logs content](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/get-job-logs-content.htm#top "Download console logs \(raw .txt job logs content\) for a job in Resource Manager.").
To view the Terraform state file (shows the state of your resources after running the job), select the name of the job to display the **Job details** page, then select **View state** under **Resources**. Optionally select **Show changes in this version**.
To view the logs for the job, select the job to open its details page, then select **Logs** under **Resources**.
To confirm existence of newly provisioned resources, [inspect resources in the compartment](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/inspect-resources.htm#top "Inspecting resources in a compartment allows you to confirm existence of a resource that you provisioned \(by running an apply job\) or absence of a resource that you released \(by running a destroy job\).").
