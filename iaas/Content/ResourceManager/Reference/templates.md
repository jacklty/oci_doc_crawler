# Oracle-Provided Templates
Review the Oracle-provided templates available for Resource Manager. A template is a prebuilt Terraform configuration for deploying cloud resources in a common scenario.
You can access templates from the Console when you [create a stack](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-stack-template.htm#top "Create a stack in Resource Manager from a template. A template is a prebuilt Terraform configuration for deploying cloud resources in a common scenario."). To browse templates of a given type, select the tab for that type. For example, to browse service templates, select the **Service** tab. After creating the stack with a template, [run an apply job](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-job-apply.htm#top "Create an apply job in Resource Manager.") on the stack to provision those resources.
**Note**
Create your own [private templates](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/managingprivatetemplates.htm#top "Reuse Terraform configurations using private templates in Resource Manager.") to share with others in the tenancy.
Common uses of templates: 
  * Test-drive the idea of infrastructure as code.
  * Apply proven best practices to your production workflow configuration. 


## Quickstarts Templates ðŸ”— 
Use Quickstarts to quickly launch and try real solutions for deployment scenarios while learning about OCI services and capabilities. [Create a stack](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-stack-template.htm#top "Create a stack in Resource Manager from a template. A template is a prebuilt Terraform configuration for deploying cloud resources in a common scenario.") with this template for consistent and repeatable deployments.
To automatically provision resources, access Quickstarts templates from the Console home page. For more information, see [Widgets](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/GSG/Concepts/console-home.htm#widgets).
