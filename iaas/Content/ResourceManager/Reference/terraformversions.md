*A job can't be created for a stack that uses an unsupported version of terraform, so stacks using these versions can't be used to manage infrastructure. To continue using an older stack, [upgrade the stack](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/upgradingstacks.htm#top "Upgrade a stack in Resource Manager to a later Terraform version.") to a supported Terraform version.
