# Terraform Configurations for Resource Manager
Review requirements and recommendations for Terraform configurations used with Resource Manager. Use Terraform and Resource Manager to install, configure, and manage resources using the infrastructure-as-code model.
For basic information about Terraform configurations, see [Authoring Configurations](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Concepts/authoring-configurations.htm#top "Write a Terraform configuration to describe infrastructure using the HashiCorp Configuration Language format \(HCL\)."). For instructions on using configurations with stacks and jobs, see [Managing Stacks and Jobs](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/managingstacksandjobs.htm#top "Use the infrastructure-as-code model to install, configure, and manage resources through Resource Manager stacks and jobs.").
For Terraform configuration sources supported with Resource Manager, see [Where to Store Your Terraform Configurations](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Concepts/terraformconfigresourcemanager.htm#sources).
In addition to writing your own Terraform configuration file, you also have the option to generate a Terraform configuration from either an existing compartment using [resource discovery](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Concepts/resource-discovery.htm#top "Discover already deployed Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources using Resource Manager.") or a [sample template](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Reference/templates.htm#top "Review the Oracle-provided templates available for Resource Manager. A template is a prebuilt Terraform configuration for deploying cloud resources in a common scenario.").
**Caution** Do not provide user credentials or other confidential information in your Terraform configurations. 
## Requirements ðŸ”— 
Terraform configuration files used with Resource Manager must meet the following requirements.
### Terraform Provider ðŸ”— 
When using Resource Manager, the `region` field in the `provider "oci"` block is the only required field. For more information about defining providers, see [Configuration File Requirements](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Concepts/authoring-configurations.htm#configuration-file-requirements).
### File Structure ðŸ”— 
Resource Manager requires the following file structure for the Terraform configuration:
  * The working directory must contain at least one `.tf` file. The working directory cannot contain a `.terraform` directory. 
The working directory is the path from which to run Terraform. By default, the working directory is the root directory of your configuration (for an uploaded configuration, the root of your `.zip` file). When using the API, you can specify a different location for the working directory by setting the `workingDirectory` parameter. 
  * The configuration must follow guidelines specified in [Authoring Configurations](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Concepts/authoring-configurations.htm#top "Write a Terraform configuration to describe infrastructure using the HashiCorp Configuration Language format \(HCL\)."). 
  * No Terraform state files (`.tfstate`) can exist in the configuration. 
  * If you plan to upload the configuration locally, then bundle all files into a `.zip` file.


### Modules ðŸ”— 
Resource Manager supports the following [Terraform module sources](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules/sources):
  * [Local paths](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules/sources#local-paths)
  * [Terraform Registry](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules/sources#terraform-registry)
  * [GitHub](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules/sources#github)
  * [Bitbucket](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules/sources#bitbucket)
  * Generic [Git](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules/sources#generic-git-repository) repositories
  * [HTTP URLs](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules/sources#http-urls)


### Variables ðŸ”— 
We recommend using a [schema document](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Concepts/terraformconfigresourcemanager_topic-schema.htm#top "Review requirements, supported types, and examples for schema documents used with Terraform configurations in Resource Manager.") with your Terraform configuration to facilitate user entry in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console.
Resource Manager does not have requirements for variables in Terraform configurations. Resource Manager supports the native Terraform behavior for handling variables. Terraform sets variables from [your variable definitions](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables#variable-definition-precedence) that use [supported type constraints](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables#type-constraints). When you [run a job](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-job.htm#top "Create a job in Resource Manager, such as plan, apply, or destroy."), the stack's variable values are added as environment variables in the Resource Manager Terraform host. For example, the VCN specified in a stack for a given VCN variable is added as an environment variable.
**Note**
When defined in the Terraform configuration, the following variables automatically prepopulate with values on the Console pages used to [create and edit the stack](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-stack.htm#top "Create a stack in Resource Manager. You can optionally postpone variables and other stack settings until after the stack is created."). The stack's values are used when you select the Terraform actions [Plan](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-job-plan.htm#top "Create a plan job in Resource Manager."), [Apply](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-job-apply.htm#top "Create an apply job in Resource Manager."), and [Destroy](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-job-destroy.htm#top "Create a destroy job in Resource Manager to release \(tear down\) resources associated with a stack and clean up the tenancy. Released resources are eventually deleted by the related OCI service. For example, a released compute instance is eventually deleted by the OCI Compute service.").
  * `tenancy_ocid` (tenancy OCID)
  * `compartment_ocid` (compartment OCID)
  * `region` (region)
  * `current_user_ocid` (OCID of the current user)


## Third-party Provider Configuration ðŸ”— 
Reference third-party Terraform providers in Terraform configurations used with Resource Manager.
By default, new Resource Manager stacks fetch third-party providers from [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers). (Unless [updated](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/update-stack-tf-reg.htm#top "Update an older stack to fetch providers from Terraform Registry."), certain older stacks fetch from [Resource Manager](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Concepts/providers.htm#third-party-older "Stacks created before Terraform Registry sourcing was available fetch third-party providers from Resource Manager. For details, see the following table.")). [Custom providers](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/update-stack-custom-providers.htm#top "Update a stack to fetch custom providers from Object Storage buckets.") are also available for new and updated stacks.
As with any provider configuration, we recommend specifying versions. [Dependency lock files](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/files/dependency-lock) are automatically managed for new and updated stacks. Providers are updated within the version constraints of the Terraform configuration. For instructions, see [Retrieving the Latest Providers](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-job-lock-file.htm#top "Within the version constraints of the Terraform configuration, retrieve the latest versions available from the configured source of Terraform providers when running a job. You can retrieve the latest providers when running the following types of jobs: plan, apply, destroy, import state, and run drift detection.").
For more information about adding providers to Terraform configurations, see [Provider Configuration](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/providers/configuration).
## Example Terraform Configuration for Resource Manager ðŸ”— 
The following example shows a Terraform configuration that's contained in a single file. This basic sample defines only one Terraform provider, one Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resource, and a set of variables.
```

variable "compartment_ocid" {}
variable "region" {}
provider "oci" {
 region = "${var.region}"
}
resource "oci_core_virtual_network" "vcn1" {
 cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
 dns_label = "vcn1"
 compartment_id = "${var.compartment_ocid}"
 display_name = "vcn1"
}
```

More often, Terraform configurations consist of two or more files bundled together (for an uploaded configuration, the files would be bundled in a .zip file). To see more complex Terraform configurations that include multiple files, explore the examples at [Terraform Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Provider Examples](https://github.com/oracle/terraform-provider-oci/tree/master/examples).
**Tip** Quickly create stacks with example OCI Terraform configurations. Go to [Terraform Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Provider Examples](https://github.com/oracle/terraform-provider-oci/tree/master/examples), navigate to the folder for the configuration you want (such as `adm`), and then select the **Deploy to Oracle Cloud** button under "Magic Button" in the readme.
## Where to Store Your Terraform Configurations ðŸ”— 
When [creating a stack with Resource Manager](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-stack.htm#top "Create a stack in Resource Manager. You can optionally postpone variables and other stack settings until after the stack is created."), you can select your Terraform configuration from the following sources.
  * Local .zip file
  * Local folder
  * Object Storage bucket
The most recent contents of the bucket are automatically used by any job running on the associated stack.
  * [Source code control system, such as Git](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/managingconfigurationsourceproviders.htm#top "Remotely store Terraform configurations using configuration source providers in Resource Manager.")
The latest version of your configuration is automatically used by any job running on the associated stack.
  * [Template](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Reference/templates.htm#top "Review the Oracle-provided templates available for Resource Manager. A template is a prebuilt Terraform configuration for deploying cloud resources in a common scenario.") (prebuilt Terraform configuration from Oracle or a [private template](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/managingprivatetemplates.htm#top "Reuse Terraform configurations using private templates in Resource Manager."))
  * Existing compartment ([Resource Discovery](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Concepts/resource-discovery.htm#top "Discover already deployed Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources using Resource Manager."))


## Schema Documents ðŸ”— 
Schema documents are recommended for Terraform configurations when using Resource Manager. See [Extend Console Pages Using Schema Documents](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Concepts/terraformconfigresourcemanager_topic-schema.htm#top "Review requirements, supported types, and examples for schema documents used with Terraform configurations in Resource Manager.").
