# Applying Free-form Tags and Defined Tags to Repositories, Images, and Image Signatures
_Find out how to add free-form tags and defined tags to repositories, images, and image signatures with Container Registry._
You can use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure tags to organize, control, manage, and report on the Container Registry resources (repositories, images, image signatures) you use. Tagging enables you to group disparate resources across compartments, and also enables you to annotate resources with your own metadata.
Typically, you'll find tagging useful for:
  * **Resource tracking:** For example, to report on some or all of the Container Registry resources you use.
  * **Cost tracking:** For example, to obtain detailed cost reports for Container Registry repositories, to enable the charging back of usage to the appropriate cost center. Note that you can only use tags applied to repositories for cost tracking purposes.
  * **Authorization grouping:** For example, to grant or limit access to repositories with a particular tag. See [Notes on the use of tags to control access to Repositories, Images, and Image Signatures](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Registry/Tasks/registrytaggingresourceswithfreeformdefinedtags.htm#registrytaggingresourceswithfreeformdefinedtagsaccessnotes).


If you have permissions to create a resource, then you also have permissions to apply free-form tags to that resource. To apply a defined tag, you must have permissions to use the tag namespace. For more information about tagging, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).

## Notes on the use of tags to control access to Repositories, Images, and Image Signatures ðŸ”— 
Having applied free-form tags and defined tags to Container Registry resources, you can include the `target.resource.tag` policy variable in where conditions in IAM policies to control access to those resources.
As with other OCI services:
  * You cannot use tags in policy statements that allow the creation of Container Registry resources. A request to create a resource would fail because the target resource has not been created yet and therefore does not have the appropriate tag to be evaluated. See [Policies that Require a Tag on the Target Resource Can't Grant Create Permissions](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Tagging/Tasks/managingaccesswithtags.htm#lim2).
  * You cannot use tags in policy statements that allow the listing of Container Registry resources. Permissions to allow the return of a list of resources must be granted through an additional policy statement. See [Permissions to List a Resource Must Be Granted Separately](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Tagging/Tasks/managingaccesswithtags.htm#list).


Note the following when writing policy statements to control access to Container Registry resources using the `target.resource.tag` policy variable:
  * The use of `repos` in policy statements covers all Container Registry resources, namely repositories, images, and image signatures. For example, consider the following policy statement:
```
allow any-user to read repos in compartment HR where target.resource.tag.mynamespace.dept= 'Sales'
```

This policy allows read access to repositories, images, and image signatures to which the `Sales` tag has been applied.
  * You must apply a tag directly to the resource to which you want to allow access. When you apply a tag to a repository, the tag is not applied to images or image signatures in the repository. Similarly, if you apply a tag to an image, the tag is not applied to an image signature created for the image. For example, consider the following policy statement:```
allow any-user to manage repos in compartment HR where target.resource.tag.mynamespace.dept= 'Marketing'
```

This policy allows manage access to any repository, any image, and any image signature to which the `Marketing` tag has been applied. Note that access is not granted to images or image signatures in a repository to which the `Marketing` tag has been applied, unless the `Marketing` tag has also been directly applied to them.
  * When authorizing an API operation to access a Container Registry resource using a tag specified by the `target.resource.tag` policy variable, you must apply the tag to a resource appropriate for the API operation. See [Details for Container Registry](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Reference/registrypolicyreference.htm).
