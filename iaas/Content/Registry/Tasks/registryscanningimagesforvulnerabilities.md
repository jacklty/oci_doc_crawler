# Scanning Images for Vulnerabilities
_Find out how to scan images in a repository for security vulnerabilities with Container Registry._
It is not uncommon for the operating system packages included in images to have vulnerabilities. Managing these vulnerabilities enables you to strengthen the security posture of your system, and respond quickly when new vulnerabilities are discovered.
You can set up Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry (also known as Container Registry) to scan images in a repository for security vulnerabilities published in the publicly available Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database. 
You enable image scanning by adding an image scanner to a repository. From then on, any images pushed to the repository are scanned for vulnerabilities by the image scanner. If the repository already contains images, the four most recently pushed images are immediately scanned for vulnerabilities. 
Whenever new vulnerabilities are added to the CVE database, Container Registry automatically re-scans images in repositories that have scanning enabled. 
For every scanned image, you can view:
  * A summary of each scan of the image for the last 13 months, showing the number of vulnerabilities found in each scan, and a single overall risk level for each scan. Image scan results are retained for 13 months to enable you to compare the scan results over time.
  * Detailed results of each image scan, to see a description of each vulnerability, along with its risk level, and (where available) a link to the CVE database for more information.


You can disable image scanning on a particular repository by removing the image scanner.
To perform image scanning, Container Registry makes use of the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Vulnerability Scanning service and Vulnerability Scanning REST API. For more information about the Vulnerability Scanning service, see [Scanning Overview](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/scanning/using/overview.htm) and [Container Image Targets](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/scanning/using/managing-image-targets.htm).
You can integrate image scanning into your existing software development and deployment lifecycle. Having built an image, your CI/CD tool can use the regular `docker push` command to push the image to a repository in Container Registry that has image scanning enabled. Your CI/CD tool can obtain the results of the image scan using the Vulnerability Scanning REST API. Based on the results of the image scan, your CI/CD tool can then determine whether to move the image to the next stage in the lifecycle. 
## Required IAM Policy for Scanning Images for Vulnerabilities ðŸ”— 
If you enable repositories for image scanning, you must give the Vulnerability Scanning service permission to pull images from Container Registry.
To grant this permission for all images in the entire tenancy:```
allow service vulnerability-scanning-service to read repos in tenancy
allow service vulnerability-scanning-service to read compartments in tenancy
```

To grant this permission for all images in a specific compartment:```
allow service vulnerability-scanning-service to read repos in compartment <compartment-name>
allow service vulnerability-scanning-service to read compartments in compartment <compartment-name>

```

## Using the Console to Enable and Disable Image Scanning ðŸ”— 
When you create a new repository, image scanning is disabled by default. You can use the Console to enable image scanning for a repository by creating a new image scanner. If image scanning has already been enabled, you can use the Console to disable it.
To enable image scanning for a repository:
  1. On the **Container Registry** list page, select the repository that you want to work with from the **Repositories and images** list. If you need help finding the list page or the repository, see [Listing Repositories](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Registry/Tasks/list-repository.htm#list-repository "Find out how to list the repositories in Container Registry.").
The repository's details section opens.
  2. Select **Add scanner** and either accept the default settings (usually sufficient) or specify:
     * **Target name** : Optionally, a name for the new image scanner.
     * **Create in compartment** : The compartment in which to create the image scanner. The compartment to which the repository belongs is selected by default, but you can select an alternative compartment.
     * **Description** : Optionally, a description of the scanner.
  3. Select the scan configuration to use.
A scan configuration identifies the images to scan, by designating the compartments to which images belong. You will typically select an existing scan configuration, or create a new scan configuration, that designates the compartment to which the repository itself belongs.
     * **Create new scan configuration** : Scan images belonging to the compartment to which the repository itself belongs, by creating a new scan configuration. Either accept the default settings (usually sufficient) or optionally enter a name for the new scan configuration, and select the compartment in which to create the new scan configuration. All the images in the repository will be scanned.
     * **Select existing scan configuration** : Scan images belonging to the compartment(s) specified in an existing scan configuration. By default, you can see and select scan configurations belonging to the same compartment as the repository. 
Select **Change Compartment** to see and select scan configurations belonging to other compartments. All the images in the repository will be scanned, provided the repository belongs to one of the designated compartments in the existing scan configuration you select.
  4. Select **Create** to create the new image scanner with the scan configuration you specified.
From now on, any images pushed to the repository are scanned for vulnerabilities by the image scanner. If the repository already contains images, the four most recently pushed images are immediately scanned for vulnerabilities. 


To disable image scanning for a repository:
  1. On the **Container Registry** list page, select the repository that you want to work with from the **Repositories and images** list. If you need help finding the list page or the repository, see [Listing Repositories](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Registry/Tasks/list-repository.htm#list-repository "Find out how to list the repositories in Container Registry.").
The repository's details section opens.
  2. Select **Remove scanner**.


## Using the Console to View Results of Image Scans ðŸ”— 
To view the results of image scans:
  1. On the **Container Registry** list page, select the repository that you want to work with from the **Repositories and images** list. If you need help finding the list page or the repository, see [Listing Repositories](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Registry/Tasks/list-repository.htm#list-repository "Find out how to list the repositories in Container Registry.").
The repository's details section opens.
  2. To see vulnerabilities detected in a particular image in the repository:
    1. Select the repository in the **Repositories and images** list a second time.
The images in the repository, including their version identifiers, are listed under the repository in the **Repositories and images** list.
    2. From the list, select the image.
  3. Select the **Scan results** tab to see a summary of each scan of the image for the last 13 months, showing:
     * **Risk level** : The risk level posed by the image, derived by aggregating the risk levels of individual vulnerabilities found in the scan into a single overall risk level.
     * **Issues found** : The number of vulnerabilities found in the scan.
     * **Scan started** : and **Scan finished** : When the scan was run.
  4. (Optional) To see more information about the vulnerabilities found in a particular scan, select **View details** from the **Action** menu beside the scan on the **Scan results** tab to open the **Scan details** dialog showing:
     * **Issue** : The name given to the vulnerability in the CVE database. Select the link to find out more information about it.
     * **Risk level** : The severity level of the vulnerability. **Critical** is the highest level (for the most serious issues that should be your highest priority to resolve), followed by **High** , then **Medium** , then **Low** , and finally **Minor** (indicating the least serious issues that you still need to resolve, but which can be your lowest priority).
     * **Description** : A description of the vulnerability.
  5. Select **Close**.
