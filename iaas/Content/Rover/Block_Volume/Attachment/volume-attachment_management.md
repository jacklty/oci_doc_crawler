Describes how to manage block volume attachment tasks, including attaching, detaching, and listing block volumes attachments, to a compute instance on your Roving Edge Infrastructure devices.
You can perform the following block volume attachment tasks:
  * [Attaching a Block Volume](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Rover/Block_Volume/Attachment/attach_volume-attachment.htm#top "Describes how to attach a block volume to a compute instance on your Roving Edge Infrastructure device.")
  * [Detaching a Block Volume](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Rover/Block_Volume/Attachment/detach_volume-attachment.htm#top "Describes how to detach a block volume from a compute instance on your Roving Edge Infrastructure device.")
  * [Listing Block Volume Attachments](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Rover/Block_Volume/Attachment/list_volume-attachment.htm#top "Describes how to list the block volumes attached to a compute instance on your Roving Edge Infrastructure device.")
  * [Getting a Block Volume Attachment's Details](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Rover/Block_Volume/Attachment/get_volume-attachment.htm#top "Describes how to get the details of a block volume attached to a compute instance on your Roving Edge Infrastructure device.")


See [Overview of Block Volume](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Block/Concepts/overview.htm) in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure documentation for more information on this feature.
