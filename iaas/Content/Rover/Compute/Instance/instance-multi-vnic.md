# Configuring the Instance OS for Secondary VNICs
On Roving Edge Infrastructure, after you create a secondary VNIC, log in to the instance OS and configure the OS to use the new VNIC.
If your instance is configured with multiple VNICs, We recommend that you configure `default.rp_filter` to either `0` (no reverse path filtering) or `2` (loose mode of reverse path filtering) in their instance so that any of the public IPs assigned to the VNICs can access the instance.
## Oracle Linux: Configuring the OS for Secondary VNICs ðŸ”— 
Use the [oci-network-config](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/oracle-linux/oci-utils/index.htm#oci-network-config) utility to perform the OS configuration required for secondary VNICs on instances that run Oracle Linux.
The [oci-network-config](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/oracle-linux/oci-utils/index.htm#oci-network-config) utility is included in [OCI Utilities](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/oracle-linux/oci-utils/index.htm#index). Instances launched with Oracle Linux 7 and later automatically have the OCI utilities (`oci-utils`) package installed. The utilities aren't available on other distributions.
## Microsoft Windows: Configuring the OS for Secondary VNICs
You must configure the secondary VNIC within the OS. You can configure the secondary VNIC manually in the Microsoft Windows OS, or create a PowerShell script.
Ensure that the script includes these actions:
  * Check if the network interface has an IP address and a default route.
  * Enable the OS to recognize the secondary VNIC, the **script must overwrite the IP address and default route with static settings (which effectively disables DHCP).** The script should prompt you with a choice: to overwrite with the static settings, or exit.


**Overall Process to Add a Secondary VNIC**
  1. [Create and attach a secondary VNIC](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Rover/Network/VNIC/attach_vnic.htm#top "Describes how to create and attach a secondary VNIC to your Roving Edge Infrastructure devices.") to the instance. Keep the VNIC OCID handy so you can provide it later when you run the configuration script. 
  2. [Connect to the instance](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/accessinginstance.htm) with Remote Desktop.
  3. Run your script as an administrator.
