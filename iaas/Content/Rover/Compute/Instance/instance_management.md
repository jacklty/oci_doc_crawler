# Instances for Roving Edge Infrastructure Devices
Describes how to perform compute instance management tasks, including creating, updating, and deleting instances, on your Roving Edge Infrastructure devices.
You can perform the following compute instance tasks:
  * [Creating an instance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Rover/Compute/Instance/create_instance.htm#LaunchInstance "Describes how to create a compute instance on your Roving Edge Infrastructure device.")
  * [Listing the instances](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Rover/Compute/Instance/list_instance.htm#ListInstance "Describes how to list the compute instances on your Roving Edge Infrastructure device.")
  * [Getting an instance's details](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Rover/Compute/Instance/get_instance.htm#GetInstance "Describes how to get the details of a compute instance on your Roving Edge Infrastructure devices.")
  * [Renaming an instance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Rover/Compute/Instance/update_instance.htm#UpdateInstance "Describes how to rename a compute instance on your Roving Edge Infrastructure device.")
  * [Terminating an instance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Rover/Compute/Instance/terminate_instance.htm#TerminateInstance "Describes how to terminate a compute instance on your Roving Edge Infrastructure device.")
  * [Powering an instance on and off](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Rover/Compute/Instance/action_vnic.htm#InstanceAction "Describes how to power a compute instance on or off on your Roving Edge Infrastructure devices.")
  * [Getting a Window instance's credentials](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Rover/Compute/Instance/get-windows-initial-creds.htm#GetWindowsInitialCreds "Describes how to get Windows instance credentials on your Roving Edge Infrastructure device.")
  * [Using the instance console connection feature](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Rover/Compute/Instance/instance-console-connection.htm#instance-console-connection "Describes how to create and manage instance console connections on a Roving Edge Infrastructure device.")


**Note**
Roving Edge Infrastructure instances do not support OCI Utilities that the Oracle Linux platform images include. See [Accessing Roving Edge Infrastructure](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Rover/Access/access.htm) for more information.
See [Working with Instances](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/instances.htm) in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure documentation for more information on this feature.
