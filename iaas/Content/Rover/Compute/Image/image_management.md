# Custom Images for Roving Edge Infrastructure
Describes how to managing custom image tasks associated with launching instances on your Roving Edge Infrastructure devices.
**Note**
  * The maximum size of an object you can use with Roving Edge Infrastructure devices is 10 TiB. Any custom images greater than 10 TiB in size are not provisioned onto your Roving Edge Infrastructure device nor included in a data synchronization.
  * You cannot create custom images or export them using a Roving Edge Infrastructure device.


You can perform the following custom image management tasks:
  * [Importing a Custom Image](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Rover/Compute/Image/import_from-object_image.htm#top "Describes how to import a custom image from an object storage bucket for use in launching an instance on your Roving Edge Infrastructure device.")
  * [Listing Images](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Rover/Compute/Image/list_image.htm#top "Describes how to list the custom images for use in launching an instance on your Roving Edge Infrastructure device.")
  * [Getting an Image's Details](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Rover/Compute/Image/get_image.htm#top "Describes how to get the details of a custom image for use in launching an instance on your Roving Edge Infrastructure device.")
  * [Editing an Image](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Rover/Compute/Image/update_image.htm#top "Describes how to edit a custom image for use in launching an instance on your Roving Edge Infrastructure device.")
  * [Removing an Image](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Rover/Compute/Image/delete_image.htm#top "Describes how to remove a custom image for use in launching an instance from your Roving Edge Infrastructure device.")
  * [Creating a Custom Image from an Instance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Rover/Compute/Image/clone_instance.htm#top "Describes how to create a custom image from an existing compute instance on your Roving Edge Infrastructure device.")
  * [Exporting a Custom Image to Object Storage](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Rover/Compute/Image/export_to-object_image.htm#top "Describes how to export a custom image to object storage on your Roving Edge Infrastructure device.")
  * [Adding an Image Shape Compatibility Entry](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Rover/Compute/Image/add_image-shape-compatibility-entry.htm#top "Describes how to add a shape to the compatible shapes list for the image on your Roving Edge Infrastructure device.")
  * [Listing Image Shape Compatibility Entries](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Rover/Compute/Image/list_image-shape-compatibility-entry.htm#top "Describes how to list the image shape compatibility entries for the image on your Roving Edge Infrastructure device.")
  * [Getting an Image Shape Compatibility Entry's Details](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Rover/Compute/Image/get_image-shape-compatibility-entry.htm#top "Describes how to get the details of an image shape compatibility entry on your Roving Edge Infrastructure device.")
  * [Removing an Image Shape Compatibility Entry](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Rover/Compute/Image/remove_image-shape-compatibility-entry.htm#top "Describes how to remove an image shape compatibility entry on your Roving Edge Infrastructure device.")
