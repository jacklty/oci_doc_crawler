# Boot Volumes for Roving Edge Infrastructure Devices 
Learn about managing boot volume tasks for a compute instance, including creating, updating, and deleting boot volumes, on your Roving Edge Infrastructure devices.
When you launch a virtual machine (VM) instance based on a platform image or custom image, a new boot volume for the instance is created. That boot volume is associated with that instance until you terminate the instance. When you terminate the instance, you can preserve the boot volume and its data.
You can perform the following boot volume management tasks:
  * [Creating a Boot Volume](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Rover/Compute/Boot_Volume/create_boot_volume.htm#CreateBootVolume "Describes how to create a boot volume for a compute instance on your Roving Edge Infrastructure device.")
  * [Listing Boot Volumes](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Rover/Compute/Boot_Volume/list_boot_volume.htm#ListBootVolume "Describes how to list the boot volumes for a compute instance on your Roving Edge Infrastructure device.")
  * [Getting a Boot Volume's Details](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Rover/Compute/Boot_Volume/get_boot_volume.htm#GetBootVolume "Describes how to get the details of a boot volume for a compute instance on your Roving Edge Infrastructure device.")
  * [Renaming a Boot Volume](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Rover/Compute/Boot_Volume/update_boot_volume.htm#UpdateBootVolumes "Describes how to rename a boot volume for a compute instance on your Roving Edge Infrastructure device.")
  * [Deleting a Boot Volume](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Rover/Compute/Boot_Volume/delete_boot_volume.htm#DeleteBootVolume "Describes how to delete a boot volume from a compute instance on your Roving Edge Infrastructure device.")
  * [Attaching a Boot Volume](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Rover/Compute/Boot_Volume/attach_boot-volume-attachment.htm#AttachBootVolume "Describes how to attach a boot volume to a compute instance on your Roving Edge Infrastructure device.")
  * [Listing Boot Volume Attachments](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Rover/Compute/Boot_Volume/list_boot-volume-attachment.htm#ListBootVolume "Describes how to list the attached instances on a boot volume for a compute instance on your Roving Edge Infrastructure device.")
  * [Getting a Boot Volume's Attachment Details](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Rover/Compute/Boot_Volume/get_boot-volume-attachment.htm#GetBootVolumeAttachment "Describes how to get the details of a boot volume attachment for a compute instance on your Roving Edge Infrastructure device.")
  * [Detaching a Boot Volume Attachment](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Rover/Compute/Boot_Volume/detach_boot-volume-attachment.htm#DetachBootVolumeAttachment "Describes how to detach a boot volume from a compute instance on your Roving Edge Infrastructure device.")


You cannot clone boot volumes on a Roving Edge device.
See [Boot Volumes](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Block/Concepts/bootvolumes.htm) in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure documentation for more information on this feature.
