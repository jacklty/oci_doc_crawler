# Deleting a Bucket from Roving Edge Infrastructure
Describes how to delete an object storage bucket on your Roving Edge Infrastructure devices.
The bucket must be empty before you can delete it. See [Deleting an Object](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Rover/Object_Storage/Object/delete_object.htm#top "Describes how to delete an object storage object contained within an object storage bucket on your Roving Edge Infrastructure devices."). If your bucket has versioning enabled, you must delete each version of all the objects contained in the bucket before you can delete the bucket. See [Deleting an Object Version](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Rover/Object_Storage/Object/delete-object-versions.htm#top "Describes how to delete a particular version of an object in an object storage bucket on your Roving Edge InfrastructureÂ device.").
