# Bulk Object Management for Roving Edge Infrastructure
Describes how to upload, download, and delete objects in bulk on your Roving Edge Infrastructure devices.
## Bulk Uploading Objects Using the CLI ðŸ”— 
Use the [oci os object bulk-upload](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/tools/oci-cli/latest/oci_cli_docs/cmdref/os/object/bulk-upload.html) command and required parameters to upload objects in bulk on a Roving Edge Infrastructure device:
```
oci os object bulk-upload --bucket-name bucket_nameÂ --src-dirÂ src_dirÂ [OPTIONS]
```

where `src_dir` is the source directory on your devices.
For example:
```
oci os object bulk-upload --bucket-name my_bucket --src-dir test_directory
Uploaded file1.txt [####################################] 100%
Uploaded file2.txt [####################################] 100%
{
 "skipped-objects": [],
 "upload-failures": {},
 "uploaded-objects": {
  "file1.txt": {
