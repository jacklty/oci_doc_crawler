# Saving Reports
Use the **Report actions** menu in Carbon Emissions Analysis to create a saved report. 
You can create a saved report by changing one of the predefined Carbon Emissions Analysis reports, and then save the custom settings as a new report. The new reports can have their own set of filters, grouping dimensions, and date range settings. You can later access the report after leaving the Console and returning to Carbon Emissions Analysis, without needing to redo your preferred dates, filters, or grouping dimensions. After a report has been saved, it can be renamed, updated, or deleted. A maximum of 50 reports can be saved.
  1. Open the navigation menu and click **Governance & Administration**. Under **Emissions Management** , click **Carbon Emissions Analysis**.
  2. From **Reports** , select one of the predefined reports, or use the default **Customer Carbon Footprint by Service** report.
  3. Make the preferred query changes. See [Using the Console](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Tasks/carbon-analysis-viewreports.htm#carbon-analysis-console) for more information on viewing reports.
  4. After making changes, the currently selected predefined report name from the **Reports** menu changes to **(edited)**.
  5. When you're done making changes, click **Save as new report**.
  6. In the **Save as new report** dialog, enter the report name in the **Name** field. Avoid entering confidential information.
  7. Click **Save**.
A notification is displayed that your report has been saved, and the report is also selected in the **Reports** menu.
  8. If you didn't already apply your custom report settings, click **Apply** to view your changes.


The new saved report is now available for future selection from the **Reports** menu under **Saved Reports**.
**Note** When the 50-report limit has been exceeded, you must select a pre-existing report from the **Overwrite existing report** dialog that you want to be overwritten with the new one.
After a report has been saved, you can rename it, reset in-progress changes, update it, or delete it.
