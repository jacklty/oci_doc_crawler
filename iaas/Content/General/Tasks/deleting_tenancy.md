# Deleting a Tenancy and Cloud Account
You can request to delete a tenancy and the associated cloud account in the Console's **Tenancy Details** page.
**Important** Deleting a tenancy permanently deletes the tenancy and the associated cloud account, and all its resources. Before deletion, we recommend you first delete any associated resources to avoid extra charges. Tenancy and cloud account deletion are irreversible and can't be undone. 
Only an OCI administrator for Free Trial customers (in a standalone tenancy scenario), or created child tenancies (in an [organization](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/organization/organization_management_overview.htm#organization_management_overview "Use Organization Management to centrally manage many tenancies, invite and create child tenancies, view and map subscriptions, and create and attach governance rules to tenancies in an organization.")) can start a self-service deletion. The following conditions must apply:
  * The tenancy is in the home region.
  * The tenancy has no child tenancies.
  * The tenancy is using an Oracle Universal Credits subscription.
  * The tenancy is [Free Tier](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Tasks/deleting_tenancy_freetier.htm#deleting_tenancy_freetier "You can request to delete a Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Free Tier tenancy and cloud account from the Console's Tenancy Details page."), Free Trial, or you upgraded to Pay As You Go (otherwise, contact a sales representative).
  * The tenancy doesn't have any [Organization Management](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/organization/organization_management_overview.htm#organization_management_overview "Use Organization Management to centrally manage many tenancies, invite and create child tenancies, view and map subscriptions, and create and attach governance rules to tenancies in an organization.") [work requests](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/workrequestoverview.htm#Work_Requests "Work requests help you monitor long-running operations such as database backups or the provisioning of compute instances.").
  * You're _signed in as the child tenancy_ , not the parent.


When these conditions are met, then the **Request tenancy deletion** button is available on the **Tenancy Details** page, enabling you to delete the tenancy and cloud account.
Parent tenancies for an [organization](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/organization/organization_management_overview.htm#organization_management_overview "Use Organization Management to centrally manage many tenancies, invite and create child tenancies, view and map subscriptions, and create and attach governance rules to tenancies in an organization.") can't be deleted, but both _standalone_ tenancies, and _child_ tenancies in an organization, can be deleted. The deletion process is different, however, for child tenancies, based on whether the child tenancy was a [created child tenancy](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Tasks/deleting_tenancy.htm#deleting_tenancy__delete-createdchild), or an [invited child tenancy](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Tasks/deleting_tenancy.htm#deleting_tenancy__delete-invitedchild) of an organization. 
**Important** Tenancy deletion isn't immediate and can take some time. Deleting the tenancy suspends all resources, and after 30 days, the tenancy is permanently deleted. After the tenancy is permanently deleted, neither you nor and any other users can sign in to the deleted tenancy.
