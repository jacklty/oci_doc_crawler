# Creating an Alarm from a Default Metric Chart
Create an alarm based on the predefined service query used to generate a default metric chart. Default metric charts are available on the **Service Metrics** page and under **Metrics** on resource details pages in the Console.
To create an alarm from the metric chart on the **Metrics Explorer** page instead, see [Creating an Alarm from a Custom Metric Chart](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Tasks/metrics-explorer-create-alarm.htm). To start from the alarm page, see [Creating a Basic Alarm](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Tasks/create-alarm-basic.htm).
  1. View default metric charts in one of the following ways:
     * [Open](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Tasks/view-chart-namespace.htm) the **Service Metrics** page.
     * [Go to the **Metrics** area](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Tasks/view-chart-resource.htm) on the details page for a resource.
  2. In the chart, select **Options** and select **Create an alarm on this query**.
The **Create Alarm** page opens, showing the query from the previous page.
  3. Provide the rest of the information needed to create the alarm.
For reference, see [Creating a Basic Alarm](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Tasks/create-alarm-basic.htm).
  4. Select **Save alarm**.

The new alarm is displayed on the **Alarm Definitions** page.
For alarm troubleshooting, see [Troubleshooting Alarms](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/troubleshooting-alarms.htm).
