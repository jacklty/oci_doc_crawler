# Domain Revocation
Oracle regularly checks that a claimed domain is still valid and assigned to the correct owner. If a domain doesn't pass this verification check, you receive an email notification and have 72 hours to update the TXT record information. If no action is taken, the domain is revoked.
If the domain is revoked but you want to reclaim it, you can [add and verify the domain](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/domain/create-domain.htm#create_domain "Add domains in Domain Management.") again.
