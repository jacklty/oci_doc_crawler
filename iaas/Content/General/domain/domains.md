# Managing Your Domains
**Domain Management** allows you to register your domains with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, as being _your_ legitimately owned domain, which blocks others from claiming that domain in the future using new cloud accounts. OCI customers can redirect new user sign-up attempts that use a corporate email address from that customer's domains.
For example, if you work at "Company A" and "companyA" is the domain name, for anyone who comes to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and tries to create a tenancy with "companyA" in the email domain, such an attempt will be prevented and they will be directed instead to OCI.
As a result, with **Domain Management** , large enterprises can more easily control their environments, by knowing who is creating tenancies, and can apply corporate policy onto such tenancies. They can securely verify ownership of your domains, and more easily control spending and management of resources.
To learn more about **Domain Management** , see the following:
  * [Required IAM Policy](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/domain/domains.htm#domainmanage_required_IAM_policy)
  * [Domain Management](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/domain/domain-management.htm#domain_management "Learn about domain management.")
  * [Domain Governance Management](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/domain/domaingov-management.htm#domaingov_management "Learn about domain governance management.")
  * [Domain Revocation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/domain/domain_revocation.htm#domain_revocation "Oracle regularly checks that a claimed domain is still valid and assigned to the correct owner. If a domain doesn't pass this verification check, you receive an email notification and have 72 hours to update the TXT record information. If no action is taken, the domain is revoked.")


## Required IAM Policy ðŸ”— 
To use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, an administrator must be a member of a group granted security access in a **policy** by a tenancy administrator. This access is required whether you're using the Console or the REST API with an SDK, CLI, or other tool. If you get a message that you don't have permission or are unauthorized, verify with the tenancy administrator what type of access you have and which **compartment** your access works in.
To use **Domain Management** , the following policies are required:
```
Allow group domainUsers to manage organizations-domain in compartmentA
Allow group domainUsers to manage organizations-domain-governance in compartmentA
```
