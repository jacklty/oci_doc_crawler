# Tagging a Tenancy
Describes how to add tagging metadata to a tenancy. You can define keys and values, and associate them with resources.
You can apply tags to a tenancy to help you organize them according to your business needs. You can apply tags when updating a tenancy. When signed in as the parent tenancy, only the parent tenancy can be tagged. When signed in as the child tenancy, only the child tenancy itself can be tagged. For more information about applying tags, see [Overview of Tagging](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Tagging/Concepts/taggingoverview.htm).
The following section describes how you can apply tagging to organization tenancies:
  * [Tag a Tenancy When Updating](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/organization/tag-organization-tenancy-update.htm#tag_organization_tenancy_update_console "Add metadata tags to an existing tenancy in Organization Management. This metadata enables you to define keys and values and associate them with resources.")


**Note**
If you aren't sure whether to apply tags, ask an administrator for guidance.
