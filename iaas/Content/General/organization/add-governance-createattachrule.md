# Creating a Governance Rule and Attaching It to a Tenancy
Create a governance rule and attach it to one or more child tenancies in your organization.
You can also attach an existing governance rule to a tenancy. See [Attaching a Governance Rule to a Tenancy](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/organization/add-governance-attachruletenancy.htm#add_governance_attachruletenancy "Attach an existing governance rule to one or more tenancies."). 
For more information about governance rules, see [Adding Governance to Tenancies](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/organization/add-governance.htm#add_governance "Use governance rules to configure and attach controls to tenancies in your organization. When a governance rule is attached to a tenancy, a corresponding resource is created and then locked in the target tenancy.").
  1. Open the navigation menu and select **Governance & Administration**. Under **Organization Management** , select **Governance Rules**.
  2. Select **Create rule**.
  3. On the **Create rule** panel, enter a name for the governance rule. Avoid entering confidential information.
  4. From **Type** , select a governance rule type: **Allowed regions** , **Quota policy** , or **Tags**.
  5. In the **Rule configuration** section, enter the following information based on the type of rule you selected:
     * If you selected **Allowed regions** , select one or more regions that the targeted tenancies are allowed to subscribe to. In **Description** , enter a name for the allowed region rule configuration. Avoid entering confidential information.
     * If you selected **Quota policy** , create a quota policy to attach to the targeted tenancies by adding quota policy statements. For more information about quota creation, syntax, and samples, see [Managing Quota Policies](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Quotas/Concepts/managing_quota_policies.htm), [Quota Policy Syntax](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Quotas/Concepts/quota_policy_syntax.htm), and [Sample Quotas](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Quotas/Concepts/sample_quotas.htm). In **Description** , enter a name for the quota policy rule configuration. Avoid entering confidential information.
     * If you selected **Tags** , create a tag namespace from your root compartment to clone onto the targeted tenancies, or define a default tag.
Select the tag namespace from the **Tag namespace** list. To view more information about the namespace, such as the **tag key** , **value type** , and **cost tracking** tag detail, and tag key description, select **View details**.
To add a default tag to the rule, select the **Add default tag** checkbox and then select a tag key from the list. You can also set **Required Tag Value Options**. Use the **Default value** option and enter the value in the **Default value** field, or select a **User-applied value**.
  6. In the **Attach rule** section, select whether to attach the rule to specific tenancies, or to all current and future tenancies that have joined organization governance (using governance rules).
     * If you select **Attach to specific tenancies** , select one or more tenancies from the **Tenancies** field. You can also choose to not select any tenancies at this point (such rules have **0** in the **Targeted tenancies** field on the associated governance rule details page).
     * If you select **Attach to entire organization** , the rule is attached to your tenancy and all your organization's tenancies that join organization governance. The rule attachment applies to both current and future tenancies.
  7. Select **Show advanced options** to specify any [tagging settings](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Tagging/Concepts/taggingoverview.htm) to organize and track resources in your tenancy. For more information about adding tags, see [Tagging a Governance Rule at Creation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/organization/tag-governancerule-create.htm#tag_governancerule_create "Describes how to add metadata to a governance rule when you first create one. You can define keys and values, and associate them with resources.").
  8. Select **Create rule**.
A new governance rule details page opens for the rule you created.
This page shows the overall rule status. You can edit or delete the rule, change the attachment method (target specific tenancies or the entire organization), add tags, view rule details, and attach or detach the rule from tenancies. For each tenancy, you can also view the rule attachment [work request](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/workrequestoverview.htm#Work_Requests "Work requests help you monitor long-running operations such as database backups or the provisioning of compute instances.") progress. If the attachment failed, select **Retry attaching** from the Actions menu (![Actions Menu](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/libraries/global-images/actions-menu.png)).


The governance rule is now configured and enforces its restrictions on the child tenancies (or if specified, the entire organization and future tenancies that join the organization). You can also view the associated governance rules by accessing the **Tenancies** page in **Organization Management**. On the **Tenancies** page, select the tenancy name to open the tenancy details page.
Under **Governance rules** , you can view the list of governance rules attached to the tenancy (to include their name and rule type). Select the governance rule name to go to the associated governance rule details page.
Meanwhile, the child tenancy that has attached governance rules can also view the rules on the **Governance rules** page, but can't interact with the rule, and can only view basic information about it, because the parent tenancy controls the rule configuration.
After the governance rule is created, you can [edit](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/organization/add-governance-editrule.htm#add_governance_editrule "Update a governance rule's configuration.") or [delete](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/organization/add-governance-deleterule.htm#add_governance_deleterule "Delete a governance rule from an organization.") the rule, [attach](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/organization/add-governance-attachruletenancy.htm#add_governance_attachruletenancy "Attach an existing governance rule to one or more tenancies.") or [detach](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/organization/add-governance-detachrule.htm#add_governance_detachrule "Detach a governance rule from one or more target tenancies in an organization.") the rule, or [change](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/organization/add-governance-changeattachmethod.htm#add_governance_changeattachmethod "Change how a governance rule is attached to tenancies in an organization.") the rule attachment method (specific tenancies or entire organization). From the parent tenancy, you can also choose to [opt a tenancy in to](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/organization/add-governance-optinuserules.htm#add_governance_optinuserules "Certain types of tenancies that are already part of the organization can opt in to use governance rules.") or [out of organization governance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/organization/remove-governance.htm#remove_governance "Start a work request to opt a tenancy out of governance rules."), or from a child tenancy, you can request to [opt in to organization governance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/organization/add-governance-optinuserules.htm#add_governance_optinuserules "Certain types of tenancies that are already part of the organization can opt in to use governance rules.").
For more information on opting out existing tenancies from governance rules, see [Removing Governance from Tenancies](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/organization/remove-governance.htm#remove_governance "Start a work request to opt a tenancy out of governance rules.").
