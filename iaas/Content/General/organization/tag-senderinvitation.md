# Tagging a Sender Invitation
Describes how to add tagging metadata to a sender invitation. You can define keys and values, and associate them with resources.
You can apply tags to a sender invitation's resources to help you organize them according to your business needs. Apply tags at the time you create an invitation, or update the invitation with tags later. For more information about applying tags, see [Overview of Tagging](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Tagging/Concepts/taggingoverview.htm).
The following sections describe how you can apply tagging to sender invitations:
  * [Tagging a Sender Invitation at Creation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/organization/tag-senderinvitation-create.htm#tag_senderinvitation_create "Describes how to add metadata to a sender invitation when you first create one. You can define keys and values, and associate them with resources.")
  * [Tagging a Sender Invitation When Updating](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/organization/tag-senderinvitation-update.htm#tag_senderinvitation_update "Add metadata tags to an existing sender invitation in Organization Management. This metadata enables you to define keys and values and associate them with resources.")


**Note**
If you aren't sure whether to apply tags, ask an administrator for guidance.
