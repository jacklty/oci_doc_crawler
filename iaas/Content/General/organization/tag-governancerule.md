# Tagging Governance Rules
Describes how to add tagging metadata to a governance rule. You can define keys and values, and associate them with resources.
You can apply tags to a governance rule to help you organize them according to your business needs. Apply tags at the time you create a governance rule, or update the governance rule with tags later. For more information about applying tags, see [Overview of Tagging](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Tagging/Concepts/taggingoverview.htm).
The following sections describe how you can apply tagging to governance rules:
  * [Tagging a Governance Rule at Creation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/organization/tag-governancerule-create.htm#tag_governancerule_create "Describes how to add metadata to a governance rule when you first create one. You can define keys and values, and associate them with resources.")
  * [Tagging a Governance Rule When Updating](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/organization/tag-governancerule-update.htm#tag_governancerule_update "Add metadata tags to an existing governance rule in Organization Management. This metadata enables you to define keys and values and associate them with resources.")


**Note**
If you aren't sure whether to apply tags, ask an administrator for guidance.
