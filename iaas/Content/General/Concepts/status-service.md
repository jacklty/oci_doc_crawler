# System Status
The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Status service allows you to see the status of OCI services in a region on a dashboard, and query service status programmatically.
**Note** The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Status dashboard shows service outages at the service or region level. Outages specific to a customer are communicated to the customer with [Console Announcements](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/announcements.htm#Console_Announcements).
## Service Highlights ðŸ”— 
  * View a dashboard that shows the health of services in a region.
  * See event information, and a history of events.
  * Programmatically query the status of services.
  * You can access the status dashboard from a provided URL.


## Status Dashboard ðŸ”— 
The Status Dashboard shows the health of each individual service in a realm. The Status Dashboard page is auto-refreshed every 5 minutes. To view the status for a region group, click on the corresponding tab at the top of the dashboard panel.

### Status Icons
Services displayed in the dashboard can show the following types of status indicator icons:
  * **Normal Performance**![](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Resources/Images/NormalPerformance.png)**:** The service is available and operating within normal parameters. This status won't have an associated event report.
  * **Informational**![](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Resources/Images/Informational.png)**:** Useful information regarding service performance is available.
  * **Service Disruption**![](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Resources/Images/ServiceDisruption.png)**:** The service is reporting a high number of request failures, resulting in the service being unavailable some of the time. This status has an associated event report.
  * **Service Down**![](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Resources/Images/ServiceDown.png)**:** The service is not available. This status has an associated event report.
  * **Dash (-):** Service not available in the region.
