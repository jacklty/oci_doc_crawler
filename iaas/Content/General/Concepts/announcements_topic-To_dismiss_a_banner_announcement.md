# Dismissing a Banner Announcement
This topic explains how to dismiss a banner announcement to stop it from appearing in the Console.
On rare occasions, the Console might display an announcements as a banner that spans the width of the top of the browser window. As long as the announcement remains in effect and you have the access required to view announcements, the banner announcement displays each time you sign in to the Console until you mark it as read.
  * To close a banner announcement until the next time you sign in to the Console, click the X at the far right edge of the banner. To stop seeing an announcement as a banner altogether, you must mark it as read.
