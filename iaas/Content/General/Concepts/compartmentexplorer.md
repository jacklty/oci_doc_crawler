# Viewing All Resources in a Compartment
This topic describes how you can use the tenancy explorer to get a cross-region view of all resources in a compartment.
## Tenancy Explorer Highlights ðŸ”— 
  * The tenancy explorer lets you view all your resources in a compartment, across all regions in your tenancy. 
  * You can choose to view just the resources that reside in the selected compartment, or you can choose to view all the resources in all the subcompartments as well, to get a full view of the compartment tree.
  * You can take actions on resources from the tenancy explorer. You can delete or move a single or multiple resources at a time. The tenancy explorer is a convenient option when you need to perform bulk delete or move actions on multiple resources.


The following image highlights these features:

When using the tenancy explorer, be aware of the following:
  * If you recently created a resource, it might not show up in the tenancy explorer immediately. Similarly, if you recently updated a resource, your changes might not immediately appear.
  * You must be in the same region as the resource to navigate to its details page. The tenancy explorer displays the resource's region. Use the region selector at the top of the Console to change to the same region as the resource to enable these actions.
  * When taking bulk actions, you can monitor progress on the Work Requests page.


## Work Requests ðŸ”— 
Tenancy explorer is one of the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure features that is integrated with the Work Requests API. For general information on using work requests in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, see [Work Requests](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/workrequestoverview.htm#Work_Requests "Work requests help you monitor long-running operations such as database backups or the provisioning of compute instances.") in the user guide, and the [Work Requests API](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/workrequests/latest/).
## Resources Supported by the Tenancy Explorer ðŸ”— 
The tenancy explorer is powered by the Search service and supports the same resource types. Most resources are supported.

## Required IAM Policy to Work with Resources in the Tenancy Explorer ðŸ”— 
The resources that you see in the tenancy explorer depend on the permissions you have in place for the resource type. 
You do not necessarily see results for everything in the compartment. For example, if your user account is not associated with a policy that grants you the ability to, at a minimum, `inspect` the `instance` resource type, then you can't view instances in the tenancy explorer. For more information about policies, see [IAM Policies Overview](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/policieshow/Policy_Basics.htm#top "IAM policies govern control of resources in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure \(OCI\) tenancies."). For information about the permissions required for the list API operation for a specific resource type, see the policy reference for the appropriate service.
**Required Permissions to View Work Requests**
Work requests inherit the permissions of the operation that spawns the work request. So if you have the permissions to move or delete a resource, you also have permission to see the work requests associated with this action.
To enable users to list all work requests in a tenancy, use a policy like the following:
Copy
```
Allow group <My_Group> to inspect work-requests in tenancy
```

## Navigating to the Tenancy Explorer and Viewing Resources ðŸ”— 
Open the **navigation menu** and select **Governance & Administration**. Under **Tenancy Management** , select **Tenancy Explorer**. 
The tenancy explorer opens with a view of the root compartment. Select the compartment you want to explore from the compartment picker on the left side of the Console. After you select a compartment, the resources that you have permission to view are displayed. The **Name** and **Description** of the compartment you are viewing are displayed at the top of the page.To also list all resources in the subcompartments of the selected compartment, select **Show resources in subcompartments**. When viewing resources in all subcompartments, it is helpful to use the **Compartment** column in the results list to see the compartment hierarchy where the resource resides. 
## Filtering Displayed Resources ðŸ”— 
To view only specific resource types, select the resource types you are interested in from the **Filter by resource type** menu. You can select multiple resources to include in the filtered list. You can also [filter the list by tags](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm#Resource_Tags).
## Opening the Resource Details Page ðŸ”— 
Detail page navigation is not supported for all resource types. If detail page navigation is not supported, the resource name does not display as a link and the option is grayed out on the Actions menu.
To open the details page for a resource:
  1. Locate the resource in the list.
  2. Verify that you are in the same region as the resource. The resource's region is listed in the tenancy explorer results. If it is not the same as the region you are currently in (shown at the top of the Console), then select the appropriate region from the **Regions** menu.
  3. To open the details page, you can either:
     * Click the name.
     * Click the the Actions menu (![Actions Menu](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/libraries/global-images/actions-menu.png)) and select **View Details**.


## Moving Resources to a Different Compartment ðŸ”— 
Not all resource-types can be moved to a different compartment. If the resource cannot be moved, the option is not selectable on the Actions menu. You must have the appropriate permissions for the resources you want to move in both the original and destination compartments. 
**Important** Ensure that you understand the impact of moving a resource before you perform this action. See the resource's service documentation for details.
[To move a single resource to a different compartment](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/compartmentexplorer.htm)
  1. Locate the resource in the list.
  2. Click the the Actions menu (![Actions Menu](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/libraries/global-images/actions-menu.png)) and select **Move Resource**.
  3. In the dialog, choose the destination compartment from the list.
  4. Click **Move Resource**.


[To move multiple resources to a different compartment](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/compartmentexplorer.htm)
To move multiple resources, the resources must be in the same compartment.
  1. Locate and select the resources in the list. 
  2. Click **Move Selected**.
  3. In the dialog, choose the destination compartment from the list.
  4. Click **Move Resource**.


The Work Request page launches to show you the status of the work request to move the resources. 
## Deleting Resources ðŸ”— 
Not all resource-types can be deleted using the tenancy explorer. If delete is not supported, the option is not selectable on the Actions menu. 
Also, if a resource is in use by another resource, you can't delete it. For example, to delete a VCN, it must first be empty and have no related resources or attached gateways.
[To delete a single resource](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/compartmentexplorer.htm)
  1. Locate the resource in the list.
  2. Click the the Actions menu (![Actions Menu](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/libraries/global-images/actions-menu.png)) and select **Delete**.
  3. In the confirmation dialog, click **Delete**.
  4. You are taken to the details page for the deleted resource.


[To delete multiple resources](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/compartmentexplorer.htm)
To delete multiple resources, the resources must be in the same compartment.
  1. Locate and select the resources in the list.
  2. Click **Delete Selected**.
  3. In the confirmation dialog, click **Delete**.


The Work Request page launches to show you the status of the work request to move the resources. 
## Using the API ðŸ”— 
For information about using the API and signing requests, see [REST API documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/usingapi.htm) and [Security Credentials](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/credentials.htm). For information about SDKs, see [SDKs and the CLI](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/sdks.htm).
Use these API operations to move or delete multiple resources at once:
  * [ListBulkActionResourceTypes](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/identity/latest/BulkActionResourceTypeCollection) - use this API to help you provide the correct resource-type information to the BulkDeleteResources and BulkMoveResources operations. The returned list of resource-types provides the appropriate resource-type name to use as input and the required identifying information for each resource-type. Most resource-types only require the OCID to identity a specific resource, but some resources, such as buckets, require you to provide other identifying information. 
  * [BulkDeleteResources](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/identity/latest/Compartment/BulkDeleteResources)
  * [BulkMoveResources](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/identity/latest/Compartment/BulkMoveResources)
