# Resource Tags
When you have many resources (for example, instances, VCNs, load balancers, and block volumes) across multiple compartments in your tenancy, it can become difficult to track resources used for specific purposes, or to aggregate them, report on them, or take bulk actions on them. _Tagging_ allows you to define keys and values and associate them with resources. You can then use the tags to help you organize and list resources based on your business needs.
There are two types of tags:
_[Defined tags](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Tagging/Tasks/managingtagsandtagnamespaces.htm)_ are set up in your tenancy by an administrator. Only users granted permission to work with the defined tags can apply them to resources. 
_[Free-form tags](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Tagging/Concepts/understandingfreeformtags.htm)_ can be applied by any user with permissions on the resource. 
For more detailed information about tags and their features, see [Overview of Tagging](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Tagging/Concepts/taggingoverview.htm).
**Tip** Watch a video to introduce you to the concepts and features of tagging: [Introduction to Tagging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7l5vQtxJFFE).
**Caution** Avoid entering confidential information when assigning descriptions, tags, or friendly names to cloud resources through the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console, API, or CLI.
