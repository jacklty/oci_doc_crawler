## About Service Limits and Usage 🔗 
When you sign up for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, a set of service limits is configured for your tenancy. The service limit is the quota or allowance set on a resource. For example, a tenancy is allotted a maximum number of compute instances per availability domain. These limits are established with the Oracle sales representative when you buy Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. If you didn't establish limits with the Oracle sales representative, or, if you signed up through the Oracle Store, default or trial limits are set for your tenancy. These limits might be increased for you automatically based on your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resource usage and account standing. You can also [request a service limit increase](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/servicelimits.htm#Requesti).
Depending on whether you have a subscription, you can view the limits and usage for it. The same service can have two different limit values, depending on which subscription you have selected on the **Limits, Quotas and Usage** page. Some services aren't tied to any subscription, but still have limit values associated with them. For more information, see [Viewing a Tenancy's Limits and Usage (By Region)](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/servicelimits.htm#To_view_your_tenancys_limits_and_usage_by_region).
## Compartment Quotas 🔗 
Compartment quotas are similar to service limits; the biggest difference is that service limits are set by Oracle, and compartment quotas are set by administrators, using policies that allow them to allocate resources with a high level of flexibility. Compartment quotas are set using _policy statements_ written in a declarative language that's similar to the IAM policy language. 
To learn more, see [Overview of Compartment Quotas](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Quotas/Concepts/resourcequotas.htm).
## Viewing Service Limits, Quotas, and Usage 🔗 
You can view a tenancy's limits, quotas, and usage in the Console. Be aware that: 
  * The Console might not display limits and usage information for all the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services or resources.
  * The usage level listed for a particular resource type could be greater than the limit if the limit was reduced after the resources were created.
  * If all the resource limits are listed as 0, this means your account has been suspended. For help, [contact Oracle Support](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/GSG/Tasks/contactingsupport.htm).


If you don't yet have a tenancy or a user account for the Console, or if you don't find a particular limit listed in the Console, see [Limits by Service](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/servicelimits.htm#Limits) for the default tenancy limits. 
### Service Limits API Policy 🔗 
For the resource availability API (usage) the policy can be at the tenant or compartment level: 
```
Allow group LimitsAndUsageViewers to read resource-availability in tenancy
Allow group LimitsAndUsageViewers to read resource-availability in compartment A
```

For limit definitions, services, and values APIs (only at the tenant level):
```
Allow group LimitsAndUsageViewers to inspect resource-availability in tenancy
```

For limit values APIs (doesn't include definitions or services), the following policy is also supported:
```
Allow group LimitsAndUsageViewers to inspect limits in tenancy
```

## Viewing a Tenancy's Limits and Usage (By Region) 🔗 
If you're in the [Administrators group](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm#The), you have permission to view the limits and usage. If you're not, here's an example [IAM policy](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm#Getting_Started_with_Policies) that grants the required permission to users in a group called `LimitsAndUsageViewers`:
Copy
```
Allow group LimitsAndUsageViewers to inspect resource-availability in tenancy
```

READ resource-availability is required to obtain the resource availability. Four APIs are available:
  * [ListServices](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/limits/latest/ServiceSummary/ListServices)
  * [ListLimitDefinitions](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/limits/latest/LimitDefinitionSummary/ListLimitDefinitions)
  * [ListLimitValues](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/limits/latest/LimitValueSummary/ListLimitValues)
  * [GetResourceAvailability](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/limits/latest/ResourceAvailability/GetResourceAvailability)


[ListServices](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/limits/latest/ServiceSummary/ListServices), [ListLimitDefinitions](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/limits/latest/LimitDefinitionSummary/ListLimitDefinitions), and [ListLimitValues](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/limits/latest/LimitValueSummary/ListLimitValues) all require INSPECT at the tenancy level, while [GetResourceAvailability](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/limits/latest/ResourceAvailability/GetResourceAvailability) requires READ at the compartment level to read the data.
**Note** The Console might not display limits and usage information for all Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services or resources.
In the Console: Open the **navigation menu** and select **Governance & Administration**. Under **Tenancy Management** , select **Limits, Quotas and Usage**.
Your resource limits, quotas, and usage for the specific region are displayed, divided by service. You can use the filters to filter by **Service** , **Scope** , **Resource** , **Subscription** , and **Compartment**.
**Note** The **Subscription** field is only selectable for certain combinations of service and scope. For example, when selecting the **Database** service and a particular **Scope** , a **< subscription_ID>-<subscription_name>** subscription can be selected, and the **Limits, Quotas and Usage** page reloads to display the limits specific to the associated subscription.
## When You Reach a Service Limit 🔗 
When you reach the service limit for a resource, you receive an error when you try to create a new resource of that type. You're then prompted to submit a request to increase the limit. You can't create a new resource until you're granted an increase to the service limit, or you delete an existing resource.
In addition, limit increase requests might not be approved because of security concerns or if limit increases aren't allowed for a particular resource.
**Note** Service limits apply to a specific scope, and when the service limit in one scope is reached, you might still have resources available to you in other scopes (for example, other availability domains).
## Requesting a Service Limit Increase 🔗 
**Note** Government Cloud customers can't use the following procedure to request a service limit increase. Instead, see [Requesting a Service Limit Increase for US Government Cloud and US Defense Cloud Tenancies](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/gov-cloud/govinfo.htm#Requesti).
You can submit a request to increase your service limits from within the Console. If you try to create a resource for which a limit has been met, you're prompted to submit a limit increase request. Also, you can open the request from the service limits page, or by clicking the link under the **Help** menu (![Help menu](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/libraries/global-images/help-menu.png)).
The following procedure applies to requests for service limit increases. For details about the subscribed region limit and how to request an increase to such limits, see [Subscribed Region Limits](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/regions.htm#limits).
  1. Open the **Help** menu (![Help menu](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/libraries/global-images/help-menu.png)). Under **Targeted help** , select **Request a limit increase**.
  2. In the **Support Chat** panel, select **Limit Increase**.
  3. You can review the solution provided by the Oracle Support Digital Assistant, or under **You can also click here to create a limit request** , select **Limit Increase**.
  4. The assistant asks you to fill out the support request in the left panel, and the **Request Service Limit Updates** panel opens.
  5. In the **Request Service Limit Updates** panel, enter the following under **Resource Limit Update (this will be your new limit**):
     * **Service Category:** Select the appropriate category for the request. 
     * **Resource:** Select the appropriate resource (for example, **Other Limits**).
Depending on the resource you select, more fields might display for more specific information.
     * **Subscription** : Optionally, select the subscription associated with the request.
When updating your service limits for a subscription, an administrator in your tenancy must set up the following required **policy** which you can view by selecting **View Policy Statement**. The **View Policy Statement** panel opens with the following policy you can copy:
Copy
```
Allow group <group_name> to READ organizations-assigned-subscription in tenancy
```

Where <group_name> is the group or groups (separated by a comma) that need access in the Console.
If you're new to policies, see [Getting Started with Policies](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm#Getting_Started_with_Policies) and [Common Policies](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/commonpolicies.htm#top).
**Note** Subscriptions aren't applicable to all resource types. If you select a subscription, the limit update applies only to resources provisioned in the associated subscription. When **None** is selected, the limit increase applies to the displayed region or availability domain.
     * **Reason for request:** Enter a reason for the request. If the request is urgent or unusual, then provide details here. Avoid entering confidential information.
Select **Additional Request** to add more request reasons.
  6. Select **Create Support Request**.


After you submit the request, it's processed. A response can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few days. If the request is granted, then a confirmation email is sent to the address provided in the primary contact details. 
If Oracle requires extra information about the request, then a follow-up email is sent to the address provided in the primary contact details.
## Limits by Service 🔗 
Click a service name to view the default limits. Note the scope that each limit applies to (for example, per availability domain, per region, per tenant, and so on). 
Service limits in this topic define their limits in terms of the following pricing models (depending on the service, however, not all apply):
  * [Oracle Universal Credits](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/universal-credits/)
  * [Pay As You Go](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/universal-credits/)
  * [Trial](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/?source=:ow:o:p:po:071520CloudPricingPromo#free-cloud-trial) (also see [Upgrading to a Paid Account](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/FreeTier/freetier.htm#freetrial__Upgradin) for more information)
  * [Always Free](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/FreeTier/freetier_topic-Always_Free_Resources.htm)


Many services have the same limits for **Pay As You Go** and **Trial** , and are listed as such in the following tables (**Pay As You Go or Trial**), while some services have different values for **Pay As You Go** compared with **Trial** , and so the **Trial** limit values are listed separately. Some services, meanwhile, can also have separate **Always Free-eligible** [resource limits](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/FreeTier/freetier_topic-Always_Free_Resources.htm).
**Note** Some services have extra limits. For more information, see the overview of each service. To view the latest limit values for a service, also see the Console's **Limits, Quotas and Usage** page.
### Dynamic Limits 🔗 
Some of these limits can appear as **Dynamic** in the Console's **Limits, Quotas and Usage** page. Oracle Universal Credits and Pay As You Go or Trial customers have access to a dynamic amount of the particular resource, based on tenancy resource consumption and growth. Access to this resource increases over time.

**Note** Limits can't be increased without SPF and DKIM set up for each sending domain.
Resource | Limit Name | Oracle Universal Credits | Pay As You Go | Trial | Always Free*

Message size (after base64 encoding and headers) | max-message-size | 2 MB | 2 MB | 2 MB | 2 MB  
**Note**
Always free resources are for a tenancy and can't be increased.
**Note** An email is defined as either a single recipient (as defined in the To:, CC:, or BCC: fields) or a 2 MB chunk of an email. 
Email examples:
  * A single request with 10 recipients (TO:, CC:, or BCC:) equals 10 emails.
  * A 10 MB email sent to a single recipient is equal to 10 MB divided by 2 MB per email. This equals 5 emails.
  * A single email request with a message size of 10 MB and 10 recipients is equal to 10 MB divided by 2 MB per email multiplied by 10 recipients. This equals 50 emails.

The email volume limit applies to unique recipients among all emails sent. For example, a single email sent to 100 recipients would count the same as 100 individual emails each sent to a single recipient.
**Note**
Email Delivery supports messages up to 2 MB, inclusive of message headers, body, and attachments. If you have SPF and DKIM set up on your sending domain, you can request this limit to be increased based on your requirement. The maximum size that can be requested is 60 MB.

[IAM With Identity Domains Limits](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/servicelimits.htm)
This is for new tenancies in regions that have been updated to use identity domains. To check that you're using the correct documentation for your IAM service, see [Cloud Identity Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/getstarted/identity-domains.htm#identity_documentation "To help you administer identity in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure \(OCI\), you need the correct documentation.").
IAM limits are **global**.
The subscription type controls the number of identity domains of each type.
See [IAM Object Limits](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/sku/overview.htm#iam-object-limits) for object limits for each identity domain type.

The limit of 500 policy statements in a tenancy is a hard limit that can't be increased. To avoid breaching policy limits, we recommend using Tag-Based Access Control (TBAC), which allows you to write one policy for many scenarios with a single statement. To learn more about TBAC, see [Using Tags to Manage Access](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Tagging/Tasks/managingaccesswithtags.htm).

## Using the API 🔗 
For information about using the API and signing requests, see [REST API documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/usingapi.htm) and [Security Credentials](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/credentials.htm). For information about SDKs, see [SDKs and the CLI](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/sdks.htm).
For more information on managing limits, see the [Service Limits API](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/limits/).
### Fractional Usage and Availability 🔗 
Some resources can have fractional usage and availability, and the Service Limits API reflects this accordingly. If the resource is a fractional one, usage reflects the **rounded up** value of the fractional usage, and for availability, the **rounded down** value of the fractional availability. As a result, these fractional availability and usage attributes help indicate the most accurate usage and availability.
For example, if a resource has 2.4 used, 4.6 available, the following API response is returned:
```
{
  used: 3,
  fractionalUsed: 2.4,
  available: 4.6,
  fractionalAvailable: 4
}
```

For more information, see the `available` and `used` attributes in the [ResourceAvailability Reference](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/limits/latest/ResourceAvailability/).
