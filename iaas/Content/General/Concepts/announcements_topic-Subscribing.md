# Subscribing to Announcements
Create and manage announcement subscriptions.
To receive only announcements that you consider relevant, create an announcement subscription. Announcement subscriptions let you configure filters that define the criteria you want announcements to meet before they're sent to subscribers. Creating an announcement subscription includes defining an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure [Notifications](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Notification/home.htm) topic to which you want to publish these filtered announcements. The announcements then arrive to you and other recipients, as appropriate, at the delivery endpoints configured in the Notifications topic.
**Note** Recipients can prepare to receive announcements from a range of different email addresses. The region of the sender email address doesn't necessarily correspond with the affected region. If you have mailbox rules for receiving email announcements, an example sender email address is noreply@mail.announcements.us-ashburn-1.oci.oraclecloud.com. For a list of region identifiers, see [About Regions and Availability Domains](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/regions.htm#About).
