# Adding a TSIG Key to a Secondary DNS Zone
You can add a TSIG key directly to a secondary domain name service (DNS) zone. A TSIG key lets DNS authenticate updates to secondary zones.
See [Managing TSIG Keys](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/DNS/Tasks/tsig.htm#manage-tsig "Transaction signature \(TSIG\), also referred to as Secret Key Transaction Authentication, ensures that domain name service \(DNS\) packets originate from an authorized sender by using shared secret keys and one-way hashing to add a cryptographic signature to the DNS packets.") for information about TSIG keys and how they're used in zones.
For information about the service, see the [DNS service overview](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/DNS/Concepts/dnszonemanagement.htm#overview "The DNS service helps you create and manage DNS zones.").
## Using the Console ðŸ”— 
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Networking**. Under **DNS management** , select **Zones**.
  2. Under **List scope** , select the compartment that contains the zone that you want to add a TSIG key to.
All zones are listed in tabular form. Select the **Zone type** header to sort zone types alphanumerically in ascending or descending order.
  3. Select the name of the secondary zone to open its details page.
  4. Under **Resources** , select **Upstream servers**.
  5. Select **Manage upstream servers**.
  6. Find the existing upstream server that you want to associate the TSIG key with, or select **Add additional server IP** to add a new one.
  7. Select an existing key or select **Create a new TSIG key** and provide the following details: 
     * **Name:** The name of the key used in domain name syntax. We recommend that the name reflect the names of the hosts and uniquely identify the key among a set of keys these two hosts might share at any particular time.
     * **Algorithm:** Select the public key's algorithm used to encrypt or decrypt data. Applicable algorithms include hmac-md5, hmac-sha1, hmac-sha224, hmac-sha256, hmac-h384, and hmac-sha512.
     * **Secret:** The base64 string encoding the binary shared secret that corresponds to the key. A maximum value of 255 characters is allowed.
     * **Show Advanced Options:** Optionally, you can apply tags. If you have permissions to create a resource, then you also have permissions to apply free-form tags to that resource. To apply a defined tag, you must have permissions to use the tag namespace. For more information about tagging, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). If you're not sure whether to apply tags, skip this option or ask an administrator. You can apply tags later.
  8. If you created a key, select **Create TSIG key**.
  9. Select **Submit**.
