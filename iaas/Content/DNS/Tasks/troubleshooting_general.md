# Common Private DNS Issues
Troubleshoot common issues with private DNS.
  * If a resolver rule matches the set conditions then the action is applied regardless of result. Later rules aren't applied. For example, if the target destination of a forward rule is unreachable, the traffic is forwarded and no further rule actions are taken.
  * When creating a **resolver** endpoint, ensure the subnet has enough available IP addresses. Listening resolver endpoints require one. Forwarding resolver endpoints require two.
  * If Compute instances want to resolve private DNS views and rules using the 169.254.169.254 resolver and they're using custom DHCP settings, 169.254.169.254 must appear in the **DHCP** nameserver list, otherwise 169.254.169.254 only resolves queries to the internet.
  * The private DNS system evaluates DNS requests in the following sequence: 
    1. Private **views** (**zones**)
    2. Rules
    3. Internet
Attached views are evaluated first in the order configured. The default view is evaluated next, unless it was included in the list of attached views. A match in the sequence ends the resolution, even if the match results in an **NXDOMAIN**. 
For example, if there were a rule to forward any name matching `onprem.example.com` to an on-premises system, but there was a zone in a private view defined as `example.com`. The private view would answer the lookup for `onprem.example.com` and the forwarding rule would never be reached.


## Serving Stale Data to Improve DNS Resiliency ðŸ”— 
  * If the private DNS service is unable to resolve a DNS request that had been resolved earlier but has an expired cache TTL, the private DNS resolver might answer the DNS request from cache per RFC8767 with a 30 second TTL. Later DNS requests try to resolve by private DNS, and might continue to be served from the stale cache for a maximum of 24 hours or until the request is successfully resolved.
