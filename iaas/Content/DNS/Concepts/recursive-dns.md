# Recursive DNS
Use the free validating recursive DNS service provided by OCI.
OCI provides a free validating recursive domain name service (DNS) **resolver** at the following public IP addresses: 
  * 216.146.35.35
  * 216.146.36.36


Using the OCI recursive DNS resolver can reduce latency because queries to the resolver remain in-cloud. The recursive DNS service is free, and anyone can use it.
To use the recursive DNS resolver, go to computer internet preferences, and replace the existing DNS service IP addresses with one of the two provided in the preceding list.
