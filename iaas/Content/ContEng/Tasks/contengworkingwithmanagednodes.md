# Working with Managed Nodes
_Find out about managed nodes, the differences between managed nodes and virtual nodes, and how to create managed nodes using Kubernetes Engine (OKE)._
Managed nodes are OCI Compute instances running in your tenancy that you control and configure, with a shared operational responsibility. Kubernetes Engine provisions and updates the Kubernetes software on managed nodes. 
By contrast, virtual nodes provide a serverless Kubernetes experience, enabling you to run containerized applications at scale without the operational overhead of managing, scaling, upgrading, and troubleshooting the node infrastructure. For a detailed comparison of managed nodes and virtual nodes, see [Comparing Managed Nodes with Virtual Nodes](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Tasks/contengcomparingmanagednodeswithvirtualnodes_topic.htm#contengcomparingmanagednodeswithvirtualnodes_topic "Find out about the differences between the managed nodes and virtual nodes you can create using Kubernetes Engine \(OKE\).").
