# Prerequisites for deploying the OCI Native Ingress Controller as a Cluster Add-on
_Find out what you have to do before you can deploy the OCI native ingress controller as a cluster add-on to load balance and route incoming traffic to service pods running on worker nodes in a Kubernetes cluster._
Before deploying the OCI native ingress controller as a cluster add-on:
  * Create a new cluster, or identify an existing cluster, that has either **VCN-native pod networking** or **Flannel overlay** as the network type. The cluster can be an enhanced cluster or a basic cluster. The cluster must be running Kubernetes version 1.28, or later. See [Creating a Cluster](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Tasks/create-cluster.htm#create-cluster "Find out how to create a cluster using Kubernetes Engine \(OKE\).").
  * Configure load balancer security rules to allow inbound and outbound traffic to and from the load balancer's subnet. See [Load Balancer Subnet Configuration](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Concepts/contengnetworkconfig.htm#subnetconfig__section_loadbalancersubnetconfig).
  * Set up an instance principal, user principal, or workload identity principal to enable the OCI native ingress controller to access other Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services and resources. See [Setting Up an Instance Principal, User Principal, or Workload Identity Principal to Enable Access to OCI Services and Resources](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Tasks/contengsettingupnativeingresscontroller-addon-prereqs.htm#contengsettingupnativeingresscontroller-addon-auth).
  * Grant permissions to the instance principal, user principal, or workload identity principal to allow the OCI native ingress controller to access resources. See [Granting Permissions to the OCI Native Ingress Controller Cluster Add-on](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Tasks/contengsettingupnativeingresscontroller-addon-prereqs.htm#contengsettingupnativeingresscontroller-addon-permissions).
  * Install cert-manager to generate and manage the TLS certificates required by the webhook server that supports the pod readiness gates feature. See [Installing cert-manager](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Tasks/contengsettingupnativeingresscontroller-addon-prereqs.htm#contengsettingupnativeingresscontroller-addon-certmanagerinstall).


## Setting Up an Instance Principal, User Principal, or Workload Identity Principal to Enable Access to OCI Services and Resources ðŸ”— 
To create a load balancer and route incoming traffic, the OCI native ingress controller, whether installed as a standalone program or as a cluster add-on, performs actions on other Oracle Cloud Infrastructure service resources (including the Load Balancer service and the Certificates service). To perform those actions on OCI service resources, the OCI native ingress controller pod uses the credentials of an authorized actor (or principal). You can currently set up the following types of principal to enable the OCI native ingress controller to perform actions on OCI service resources:
  * **Instance principal:** The OCI native ingress controller uses the identity of the instance on which it is running. See [Using instance principals to enable access to OCI services and resources](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Tasks/contengsettingupnativeingresscontroller-addon-prereqs.htm#contengsettingupnativeingresscontroller-addon-auth__section_instanceprincipalauthenticaton).
  * **User principal:** The OCI native ingress controller uses an OCI user's identity. See [Using user principals to enable access to OCI services and resources](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Tasks/contengsettingupnativeingresscontroller-addon-prereqs.htm#contengsettingupnativeingresscontroller-addon-auth__section_userprincipalauthenticaton).
  * **Workload identity principal:** The OCI native ingress controller uses the identity of a workload resource running on a Kubernetes cluster. See [Using workload identity principals to enable access to OCI services and resources](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Tasks/contengsettingupnativeingresscontroller-addon-prereqs.htm#contengsettingupnativeingresscontroller-addon-auth__section_workloadidentityauthenticaton).


Note:
  * The use of instance principals to enable the OCI native ingress controller to access OCI services and resources is not supported in clusters with virtual nodes.
  * The use of workload identity principals to enable the OCI native ingress controller to access OCI services and resources is supported with enhanced clusters, but not with basic clusters.


### Using instance principals to enable access to OCI services and resources ðŸ”— 
You can set up an instance principal to enable the OCI native ingress controller to perform actions on OCI service resources. Note that you can only use instance principals with managed nodes.
To set up an instance principal:
  1. Create a new dynamic group to contain the compute instances hosting the cluster's worker nodes:
    1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Domains**. Under **Identity domain** , select **Dynamic groups**. 
    2. Select the compartment to which the compute instances belong.
    3. Follow the instructions in [To create a dynamic group](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingdynamicgroups.htm#To), and give the dynamic group a name (for example, `acme-oke-native-ingress-controller-dyn-grp`).
    4. Enter a rule that includes the compute instances in the compartment, in the format:
Copy
```
ALL {instance.compartment.id = '<compartment-ocid>'}
```

where `<compartment-ocid>` is the OCID of the compartment in which cluster node pools are created.
For example:
```
ALL {instance.compartment.id = 'ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaaaa23______smwa'}
```

    5. Click **Create Dynamic Group**.


Before you deploy the OCI native ingress controller, you will:
  * Grant permissions to the instance on which the OCI native ingress controller is running via the dynamic group. See [Granting Permissions to the OCI Native Ingress Controller Cluster Add-on](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Tasks/contengsettingupnativeingresscontroller-addon-prereqs.htm#contengsettingupnativeingresscontroller-addon-permissions).
  * Indicate you want to use instance principals with the OCI native ingress controller add-on by setting the `authType` configuration argument to `instance`. For example:
```
  {
   "key": "authType",
   "value": "instance"
  }
```

See [Deploying the OCI Native Ingress Controller Add-on](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Tasks/contengsettingupnativeingresscontroller-addon-installing-creating-resources.htm#contengsettingupnativeingresscontroller-addon-Deploying)


### Using user principals to enable access to OCI services and resources ðŸ”— 
You can set up a user principal to enable the OCI native ingress controller to perform actions on OCI service resources.
To set up a user principal:
  1. If a suitable user does not exist already, create a user in IAM (see [To create a user](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingusers.htm#create_user)).
  2. If a suitable group does not exist already, create a group in IAM (see [To create a group](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managinggroups.htm#To)).
  3. Add the user to the group (see [To add a user to a group](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingusers.htm#add_user)). 
  4. Get these items: 
     * RSA key pair **in PEM format** (minimum 2048 bits). See [How to Generate an API Signing Key](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm#two). 
     * Fingerprint of the public key. See [How to Get the Key's Fingerprint](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm#four). 
     * Tenancy's OCID and user's OCID. See [Where to Get the Tenancy's OCID and User's OCID](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm#five). 
  5. Upload the public key from the key pair in the Console. See [How to Upload the Public Key](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm#three). 
  6. Create a config file as a .yaml file containing credential information, in the following format:
Copy
```
auth:
 region: <region-identifier>
 passphrase: <passphrase>
 user: <user-ocid>
 fingerprint: <fingerprint>
 tenancy: <tenancy-ocid>
```

where:
     * `region: <region-identifier>` is the region where the cluster resides. For example, `us-ashburn-1`
     * `passphrase: <passphrase>` specifies the passphrase used for the key if it is encrypted. 
     * `user: <user-ocid>` is the OCID of the user that the OCI native ingress controller is to use.
     * `fingerprint: <fingerprint>` is the fingerprint of the public key.
     * `tenancy: <tenancy-ocid>` is the OCID of the tenancy containing the cluster.
For example:
```
auth:
 region: us-ashburn-1
 passphrase: examplepass
 user: ocid1.user.oc1..aaaaaaaa_example
 fingerprint: 67:d9:74:4b:21:example
 tenancy: ocid1.tenancy.oc1..aaaaaaaa_example
```

  7. Create a Kubernetes secret resource in the cluster by entering:
Copy
```

kubectl create secret generic <secret-name> \
--from-file=config=<config-file>.yaml \
--from-file=private-key=<private-key-file-path>.pem \
--namespace <namespace>
```

where:
     * `<secret-name>` specifies the name of the secret to create. For example, `oci-config`
     * `--from-file=config=<config-file>.yaml` specifies the name and path of the .yaml file containing the credential information that you created previously. For example, `user-auth-config.yaml`
     * `--from-file=private-key=./oci/oci_api_key.pem` specifies the name and path of the downloaded private key file. For example, `./oci/oci_api_key.pem`
     * `--namespace <namespace>` specifies the namespace containing the OCI native ingress controller
For example:
```

kubectl create secret generic oci-config \
--from-file=config=user-auth-config.yaml \
--from-file=private-key=./oci/oci_api_key.pem \
--namespace acme-namespace
```



Before you deploy the OCI native ingress controller you will:
  * Grant permissions to the user via the group to which the user belongs. See [Granting Permissions to the OCI Native Ingress Controller Cluster Add-on](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Tasks/contengsettingupnativeingresscontroller-addon-prereqs.htm#contengsettingupnativeingresscontroller-addon-permissions).
  * Indicate you want to use user principals with the OCI native ingress controller add-on by setting the following configuration arguments:
    * set `authType` to `user`
    * set `authSecretName` to the name of the Kubernetes secret you created previously
For example:
```
  {
   "key": "authType",
   "value": "user"
  },
  {
   "key": "authSecretName",
   "value": "oci-config"
  }
```

See [Deploying the OCI Native Ingress Controller Add-on](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Tasks/contengsettingupnativeingresscontroller-addon-installing-creating-resources.htm#contengsettingupnativeingresscontroller-addon-Deploying)


### Using workload identity principals to enable access to OCI services and resources ðŸ”— 
You can set up a workload identity principal to enable the OCI native ingress controller to perform actions on OCI service resources. Note that you can only use workload identity principals with enhanced clusters.
To set up a workload identity principal:
  1. Obtain the OCID of the cluster (for example, using the **Cluster Details** tab in the Console).


Before you deploy the OCI native ingress controller, you will:
  * Grant permissions to the OCI native ingress controller workload identity. See [Granting Permissions to the OCI Native Ingress Controller Cluster Add-on](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Tasks/contengsettingupnativeingresscontroller-addon-prereqs.htm#contengsettingupnativeingresscontroller-addon-permissions).
  * Indicate you want to use workload identity principals with the OCI native ingress controller add-on by setting the `authType` configuration argument to `workloadIdentity`. For example:```
  {
   "key": "authType",
   "value": "workloadIdentity"
  }
```

See [Deploying the OCI Native Ingress Controller Add-on](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Tasks/contengsettingupnativeingresscontroller-addon-installing-creating-resources.htm#contengsettingupnativeingresscontroller-addon-Deploying)


## Granting Permissions to the OCI Native Ingress Controller Cluster Add-on ðŸ”— 
The OCI native ingress controller requires permissions to access resources created by other Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services (such as the Load Balancer service and the Certificates service). The permissions you grant are the same, regardless of whether you install the OCI native ingress controller as a standalone program or as a cluster add-on. And the permissions are the same, regardless of whether you have set up an instance principal, a user principal, or a workload identity principal for the OCI native ingress controller. However, the way in which you grant those permissions does depend on the type of principal you have set up:
  * When using instance principals, the OCI native ingress controller inherits the permissions granted to the instance on which it is running via a dynamic group to which the instance belongs. For information about creating the dynamic group for instance principals, see [Using instance principals to enable access to OCI services and resources](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Tasks/contengsettingupnativeingresscontroller-addon-prereqs.htm#contengsettingupnativeingresscontroller-addon-auth__section_instanceprincipalauthenticaton).
  * When using user principals, the OCI native ingress controller inherits the permissions granted to a user via a group to which the user belongs. For information about creating the user and the group for user principals, see [Using user principals to enable access to OCI services and resources](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Tasks/contengsettingupnativeingresscontroller-addon-prereqs.htm#contengsettingupnativeingresscontroller-addon-auth__section_userprincipalauthenticaton).
  * When using workload identity principals, the OCI native ingress controller inherits the permissions granted to a workload running on a specified cluster, in the Kubernetes service account and namespace created for the OCI native ingress controller during installation. For more information, see [Using workload identity principals to enable access to OCI services and resources](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Tasks/contengsettingupnativeingresscontroller-addon-prereqs.htm#contengsettingupnativeingresscontroller-addon-auth__section_workloadidentityauthenticaton).


To set up permissions for the OCI native ingress controller, create a policy for the group (in the case of user principals), for the dynamic group (in the case of instance principals), or for the workload (in the case of workload identity principals), with policy statements to access OCI services and resources:
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Policies**.
  2. Follow the instructions in [To create a policy](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingpolicies.htm#To_create_a_policy) and give the policy a name (for example, `acme-oke-native-ingress-controller-policy`).
  3. If you are using instance principals or user principals, enter policy statements to allow access to the OCI services and resources used by the OCI native ingress controller, in the format:
Copy
```
Allow <group|dynamic-group> <subject-name> to <verb> <resource> in <location>  

```

where:
     * `<group|dynamic-group>` is either `group` (in the case of user principals) or `dynamic-group` (in the case of instance principals)
     * `<subject-name>` is either the name of the group (in the case of user principals) or the name of the dynamic group (in the case of instance principals). For example, `acme-oke-nat-ing-cont-dyn-grp`. Note that if a group or dynamic group is not in the default identity domain, prefix the group or dynamic group name with the identity domain name, in the format `<group|dynamic-group> '<identity-domain-name>'/'<group-name|dynamic-group-name>'`. You can also specify a group or dynamic group using its OCID, in the format `group id <group-ocid>` or `dynamic-group id <dynamic-group-ocid>`.
     * `<verb> <resource>` is one of the following (all of these are required, in separate policy statements):
       * `manage load-balancers`
       * `use virtual-network-family`
       * `manage cabundles`
       * `manage cabundle-associations`
       * `manage leaf-certificates`
       * `read leaf-certificate-bundles`
       * `manage leaf-certificate-versions`
       * `manage certificate-associations`
       * `read certificate-authorities`
       * `manage certificate-authority-associations`
       * `read certificate-authority-bundles`
       * `read public-ips`
       * `manage floating-ips`
       * `manage waf-family`
       * `read cluster-family`
       * `use tag-namespaces` (only required if you want the OCI native ingress controller to apply defined tags to load balancers, see [Applying defined tags to the load balancer](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Tasks/contengsettingupnativeingresscontroller-configuring.htm#contengsettingupnativeingresscontroller_addingtags__native-ingress-controller-lb-defined-tags))
     * `<location>` is one of:
       * `tenancy`, if you want the OCI native ingress controller to have access to resources in the entire tenancy.
       * `compartment <compartment-name>` if you only want the OCI native ingress controller to have access to resources in the compartment with the name you specify as `compartment <compartment-name>`.
For example:
```
Allow dynamic-group acme-oke-nat-ing-cont-dyn-grp to manage load-balancers in compartment acme-oke-cluster-compartment
```

The syntax for the complete list of policy statements is as follows:
Copy
```

## Installing cert-manager ðŸ”— 
The OCI native ingress controller, whether installed as a standalone program or as a cluster add-on, uses webhooks to inject pod readiness gates into pod specifications. To ensure security, the webhook server has to run in HTTPS mode, which requires a pair of certificates and keys. The OCI native ingress controller uses Certificate Manager (also known as cert-manager) to generate and manage the certificates and keys for the webhook server, so you have to install cert-manager on the cluster to use pod readiness gates.
Regardless of whether you install the OCI native ingress controller as a standalone program or as a cluster add-on, you can install and run cert-manager in two ways:
  * You can install and run cert-manager as an open-source product, by entering:

  * You can install and run cert-manager as a cluster add-on. For more information about installing cert-manager as a cluster add-on, see [Installing a Cluster Add-on](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Tasks/install-add-on.htm#install-add-on "Find out how to install a cluster add-on using Kubernetes Engine \(OKE\).").


For more information about cert-manager, see the [cert-manager.io documentation](https://cert-manager.io/docs/).
Note that installation of the OCI native ingress controller as a cluster add-on fails if you haven't already installed cert-manager, either as an open source product or as a cluster add-on.
