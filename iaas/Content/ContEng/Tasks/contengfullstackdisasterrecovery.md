# Setting Up Full Stack Disaster Recovery for Kubernetes Engine
_Find out more about setting up Full Stack Disaster Recovery for clusters created with Kubernetes Engine (OKE)._
The OCI Full Stack Disaster Recovery service is a cloud-native disaster recovery orchestration and management service that provides comprehensive disaster recovery capabilities for all layers of an application stack, including infrastructure, middleware, database, and applications. 
When using Full Stack Disaster Recovery, you can add Kubernetes clusters that you have created with Kubernetes Engine to disaster recovery protection groups, enabling you to automate the end-to-end recovery orchestration of your Kubernetes system between OCI regions.
For more information, see the [Full Stack Disaster Recovery documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/disaster-recovery/index.html), and the following sections in particular:
