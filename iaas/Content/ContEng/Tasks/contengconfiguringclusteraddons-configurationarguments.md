# Cluster Add-on Configuration Arguments
_Find out about the configuration arguments that you can pass to cluster add-ons._
When you enable a cluster add-on, you can specify one or more key/value pairs to pass as arguments to the cluster add-on.
If the value of a key is required in JSON format, you can specify the value in plain text or Base64 encoded. For example, you could specify either of the following as the value of the `coreDnsContainerResources` key:
  * `{"limits": {"cpu": "500m", "memory": "200Mi" }, "requests": {"cpu": "100m", "memory": "100Mi"}}` (plain text)
  * `eyJsaW1pdHMiOiB7ImNwdSI6ICI1MDBtIiwgIm1lbW9yeSI6ICIyMDBNaSIgfSwgInJlcXVlc3RzIjogeyJjcHUiOiAiMTAwbSIsICJtZW1vcnkiOiAiMTAwTWkifX0=` (Base64 encoded)


If the value of a key is required in JSON form, depending on the OCI tool you are using, you might have to escape double quotation marks in the key value with single backslash characters, as follows:
  * If you are specifying the value of a key when using the Console, do not escape double quotation marks in the key value. For example, when using the Console to specify the value of the `cluster-autoscaler container resources` key, enter the following:```
{"limits":{"cpu": "250m", "memory": "400Mi"}, "requests": {"cpu": "50m", "memory": "200Mi"}}
```

  * If you are specifying the value of a key when using the CLI or API, always escape double quotation marks in the key value with a single backslash. For example, when using the CLI to specify the value of the `cluster-autoscaler container resources` key, use the following notation:```
{ "key": "cluster-autoscaler.ContainerResources", "value": "{\"limits\":{\"cpu\": \"250m\", \"memory\": \"400Mi\"}, \"requests\": {\"cpu\": \"50m\", \"memory\": \"200Mi\"}}" }
```

## Tiller add-on configuration arguments (not recommended) ðŸ”— 
When you enable the Tiller cluster add-on, you can pass the following key/value pairs as arguments.
Note that Tiller was removed from Helm in version 3 (and later versions) due to known security risks. Because of those security risks, we strongly recommend that you do not deploy Tiller on production clusters. For the same reason, the Tiller add-on is not shown in the Console. If you decide that you do want to deploy the Tiller add-on despite the security risks, use the OCI CLI or API.

JSON format in plain text or Base64 encoded. | Optional | null | `[{"key":"tolerationKeyFoo", "value":"tolerationValBar", "effect":"noSchedule", "operator":"exists"}]`Only pods that have this toleration can run on worker nodes that have the `tolerationKeyFoo=tolerationValBar:noSchedule` taint.  
topologySpreadConstraints | topologySpreadConstraints |  How to spread matching pods among the given topology. JSON format in plain text or Base64 encoded. | Optional | null | null

Key (API and CLI) | Key's Display Name (Console) | Description | Required/Optional | Default Value | Example Value  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
metrics-server.ContainerResources | metrics-server container resources |  You can specify the resource quantities that the add-on containers request, and set resource usage limits that the add-on containers cannot exceed. JSON format in plain text or Base64 encoded. | Optional | null | `{"limits": {"cpu": "500m", "memory": "200Mi" }, "requests": {"cpu": "100m", "memory": "100Mi"}}`Create add-on containers that request 100 milllicores of CPU, and 100 mebibytes of memory. Limit add-on containers to 500 milllicores of CPU, and 200 mebibytes of memory.  
## NVIDIA GPU Plugin add-on configuration arguments ðŸ”— 
When you enable the NVIDIA GPU Plugin cluster add-on, you can pass the following key/value pairs as arguments.
Note that to ensure that workloads running on NVIDIA GPU worker nodes are not interrupted unexpectedly, we recommend that you choose the version of the NVIDIA GPU Plugin add-on to deploy, rather than specifying that you want Oracle to update the add-on automatically.
[Configuration Arguments Common to all Cluster Add-ons](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Tasks/contengconfiguringclusteraddons-configurationarguments.htm)
Key (API and CLI) | Key's Display Name (Console) | Description | Required/Optional | Default Value | Example Value  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
affinity | affinity |  A group of affinity scheduling rules. JSON format in plain text or Base64 encoded. | Optional | null | null  
nodeSelectors | node selectors |  You can use node selectors and node labels to control the worker nodes on which add-on pods run.  For a pod to run on a node, the pod's node selector must have the same key/value as the node's label. Set **nodeSelectors** to a key/value pair that matches both the pod's node selector, and the worker node's label. JSON format in plain text or Base64 encoded. | Optional | null | `{"foo":"bar", "foo2": "bar2"}`The pod will only run on nodes that have the `foo=bar` or `foo2=bar2` label.  
numOfReplicas | numOfReplicas | The number of replicas of the add-on deployment. | Required | `1`Creates one replica of the add-on deployment per cluster. | `2`Creates two replicas of the add-on deployment per cluster.  
rollingUpdate | rollingUpdate |  Controls the desired behavior of rolling update by maxSurge and maxUnavailable. JSON format in plain text or Base64 encoded. | Optional | null | null  
tolerations | tolerations |  You can use taints and tolerations to control the worker nodes on which add-on pods run. For a pod to run on a node that has a taint, the pod must have a corresponding toleration. Set **tolerations** to a key/value pair that matches both the pod's toleration, and the worker node's taint. JSON format in plain text or Base64 encoded. | Optional | null | `[{"key":"tolerationKeyFoo", "value":"tolerationValBar", "effect":"noSchedule", "operator":"exists"}]`Only pods that have this toleration can run on worker nodes that have the `tolerationKeyFoo=tolerationValBar:noSchedule` taint.

Key (API and CLI) | Key's Display Name (Console) | Description | Required/Optional | Default Value | Example Value  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
deviceIdStrategy | Device ID Strategy |  Which strategy to use for passing device IDs to the underlying runtime.  One of:
  * `uuid`
  * `index`

| Optional | `uuid`  
deviceListStrategy | Device List Strategy |  Which strategy to use for passing the device list to the underlying runtime.  Supported values:
  * `envvar`
  * `volume-mounts`
  * `cdi-annotations`
  * `cdi-cri`

Multiple values are supported, in a comma-separated list. | Optional | `envvar`  
driverRoot | Driver Root | The root path for the NVIDIA driver installation. | Optional | `/`  
failOnInitError | FailOnInitError |  Whether to fail the plugin if an error is encountered during initialization.  When set to `false`, blocks the plugin indefinitely instead of failing. | Optional | `true`  
gpu-device-plugin.ContainerResources | gpu-device-plugin container resources |  You can specify the resource quantities that the add-on containers request, and set resource usage limits that the add-on containers cannot exceed. JSON format in plain text or Base64 encoded. | Optional | null | `{"limits": {"cpu": "500m", "memory": "200Mi" }, "requests": {"cpu": "100m", "memory": "100Mi"}}`Create add-on containers that request 100 milllicores of CPU, and 100 mebibytes of memory. Limit add-on containers to 500 milllicores of CPU, and 200 mebibytes of memory.  
migStrategy | MIG Strategy |  Which strategy to use for exposing MIG (Multi-Instance GPU) devices on GPUs that support it. One of:
  * `none`
  * `single`
  * `mixed`

| Optional | `none`  
passDeviceSpecs | Pass Device Specs | Whether to pass the paths and desired device node permissions for any NVIDIA devices being allocated to the container. | Optional | `false`  
useConfigFile | Use Config File from ConfigMap |  Whether to use a configuration file to configure the Nvidia Device Plugin for Kubernetes. The configuration file is derived from a ConfigMap. If set to `true`, you have to create a ConfigMap in the cluster, name the ConfigMap `nvidia-device-plugin-config`, and specify values for configuration arguments. See [Example](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Tasks/contengconfiguringclusteraddons-configurationarguments.htm#contengconfiguringclusteraddons_configurationarguments_nvidiagpuplugin__example-configmap). The ConfigMap is referenced by the `nvidia-gpu-device-plugin` daemonset.  | Optional | `false`  
**Example of`nvidia-device-plugin-config` ConfigMap:**
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata: 
 name: nvidia-device-plugin-config 
 namespace: kube-system
data:
 config.yaml: |
  version: v1
  flags:
   migStrategy: "none"
   failOnInitError: true
   nvidiaDriverRoot: "/"
   plugin:
    passDeviceSpecs: false
    deviceListStrategy: envvar
    deviceIDStrategy: uuid
