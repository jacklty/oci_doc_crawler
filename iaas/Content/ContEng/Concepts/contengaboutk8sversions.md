# Supported Versions of Kubernetes
_Find out about the Kubernetes versions that Kubernetes Engine (OKE) currently supports, along with details of previously supported versions and planned support for future versions._
When Kubernetes Engine support for a new version of Kubernetes is announced, an older Kubernetes version will subsequently cease to be supported. Oracle recommends that you upgrade existing clusters to use the most recent Kubernetes version that Kubernetes Engine supports.
This topic lists:
  * [Currently Supported Kubernetes Versions](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Concepts/contengaboutk8sversions.htm#supportedk8sversions)
  * [Planned Support for Future Kubernetes Versions](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Concepts/contengaboutk8sversions.htm#contengaboutk8sversions_topic-Planned_Kubernetes_Versions_Support)
  * [Previously Supported Kubernetes Versions](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Concepts/contengaboutk8sversions.htm#previouslysupportedk8sversions)


## Currently Supported Kubernetes Versions ðŸ”— 
Kubernetes Engine supports three versions of Kubernetes for new clusters. For a minimum of 30 days after the announcement of support for a new Kubernetes version, Kubernetes Engine continues to support the fourth oldest available Kubernetes version. After that time, the older Kubernetes version ceases to be supported.
When creating a new cluster with Kubernetes Engine, Oracle recommends that you use the most recent Kubernetes version that Kubernetes Engine supports. When Oracle announces Kubernetes Engine support for a new Kubernetes version, Oracle recommends you upgrade existing clusters to use that new Kubernetes version as soon as possible.
### Release Calendar
Kubernetes Engine (OKE) supports the following versions of Kubernetes for new clusters:
Kubernetes Minor Version | Kubernetes Patch Version Supported by OKE | Upstream Minor Version Release Date | Upstream Minor Version End-of-life date | OKE Release Date | OKE End-of-life Date  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
1.31 | 1.31.1 | 2024-08-13 | 2025-10-28 | 2024-11-25 | 30 days after 1.34 OKE Release Date (planned)  
1.30 | 1.30.1 | 2024-04-17 | 2025-06-28 | 2024-07-23 | 30 days after 1.33 OKE Release Date (planned)  
1.29 | 1.29.10 | 2023-12-13 | 2025-02-28 | 2025-01-22 | 30 days after 1.32 OKE Release Date (planned)

### Notes about Kubernetes Engine Support for Kubernetes Version 1.30
Note that Kubernetes Engine support for Kubernetes version 1.30 also introduces changes to default Kubernetes Engine behavior with regards CPU and memory reservation. On clusters running Kubernetes version 1.30 and later, CPU and memory resources for managed nodes are reserved by default, using the `--kube-reserved` and `--system-reserved` kubelet flags respectively (as recommended in [Best Practice: Reserve resources for Kubernetes and OS system daemons](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Tasks/contengbestpractices_topic-Cluster-Management-best-practices.htm#contengbestpractices_topic-Cluster-Management-best-practices__ManagingOKEClusters-Reserveresourcesforkubernetesandossystemdaemons)). As a result, on clusters running Kubernetes version 1.30 and later, there is a difference between a node's _total_ resources, and the resources that are _available_ for workloads to request. For more information, see [Best Practice: Reserve resources for Kubernetes and OS system daemons](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Tasks/contengbestpractices_topic-Cluster-Management-best-practices.htm#contengbestpractices_topic-Cluster-Management-best-practices__ManagingOKEClusters-Reserveresourcesforkubernetesandossystemdaemons).
### Notes about Kubernetes Engine Support for Kubernetes Version 1.28
Note that in Kubernetes version 1.28, the Kubernetes skew policy has expanded. Prior to Kubernetes version 1.28, the skew policy required a cluster's control plane nodes to be no more than two versions ahead of worker nodes. Starting from Kubernetes version 1.28, the Kubernetes skew policy allows control plane nodes to be up to three versions ahead of worker nodes. See the [Kubernetes version skew support policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/version-skew-policy/).
Kubernetes Engine applies the expanded skew policy to clusters running Kubernetes version 1.28 and later. 
### Notes about Kubernetes Engine Support for Kubernetes Version 1.27
Note that Kubernetes version 1.27 stopped serving the following deprecated Kubernetes API:
  * CSIStorageCapacity (storage.k8s.io/v1beta1 API version)


For more information about migrating from the deprecated APIs, see the [Kubernetes Deprecated API Migration Guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/#v1-27).
### Notes about Kubernetes Engine Support for Kubernetes Version 1.26
Note that Kubernetes version 1.26 stopped serving a number of deprecated Kubernetes APIs, including:
  * FlowSchema (flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1beta1 API version)
  * HorizontalPodAutoscaler (autoscaling/v2beta2 API version)
  * PriorityLevelConfiguration (flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1beta1 API version)


For more information about migrating from the deprecated APIs, see the [Kubernetes Deprecated API Migration Guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/#v1-26).
Support for Kubernetes version 1.26.7 was released to address the following upstream issues with Kubernetes version 1.26.2:
  * <https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/3849>: A bug in kubelet causes a memory leak on nodes using cgroup v1 on the 5.15 Linux kernel. Oracle Linux 8.7 images use the 5.15 Linux kernel, so Oracle Linux 8.7 images are impacted by the bug.
  * <https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/issues/6805>: Metrics are missing after a crio restart.


### Notes about Kubernetes Engine Support for Kubernetes Version 1.25
Note that Kubernetes version 1.25 stopped serving a number of deprecated Kubernetes APIs, including:
  * CronJob (batch/v1beta1 API version)
  * EndpointSlice (discovery.k8s.io/v1beta1 API version)
  * Event (events.k8s.io/v1beta1 API version)
  * HorizontalPodAutoscaler (autoscaling/v2beta1 API version)
  * PodDisruptionBudget (policy/v1beta1 API version)
  * PodSecurityPolicy (policy/v1beta1 API version)
  * RuntimeClass (node.k8s.io/v1beta1 API version)


For more information about migrating from the deprecated APIs, see the [Kubernetes Deprecated API Migration Guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/#v1-25).
Support for Kubernetes version 1.25.12 was released to address the following upstream issues with Kubernetes version 1.25.4:
  * <https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/3849>: A bug in kubelet causes a memory leak on nodes using cgroup v1 on the 5.15 Linux kernel. Oracle Linux 8.7 images use the 5.15 Linux kernel, so Oracle Linux 8.7 images are impacted by the bug.
  * <https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/issues/6805>: Metrics are missing after a crio restart.


**Note**
The upstream Kubernetes project deprecated pod security policies in Kubernetes version 1.21, and removed the feature in Kubernetes version 1.25. Consequently, Kubernetes Engine does not support pod security policies and the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller in clusters running Kubernetes version 1.25 and later.
If you require similar functionality, consider using Kubernetes pod security standards and the PodSecurity admission controller instead (along with the Privileged, Baseline, and Restricted policies). By default, Kubernetes Engine enables the PodSecurity admission controller in clusters running Kubernetes version 1.23 and later, in order to support pod security standards. For more information about Kubernetes pod security standards, and the PodSecurity admission controller, see [Pod Security Standards](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/) in the Kubernetes documentation.
Alternatively, consider using other alternatives that are being developed in the Kubernetes ecosystem to enforce policies.
If you do decide to move from using pod security policies and the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller to using pod security standards and the PodSecurity admission controller, see [Migrate from PodSecurityPolicy to the Built-In PodSecurity Admission Controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/migrate-from-psp/) in the Kubernetes documentation. Note that it is important to complete the migration before creating a new cluster running Kubernetes version 1.25, or before upgrading an existing Kubernetes version 1.24 cluster to run Kubernetes version 1.25. Also note that the Console provides a convenient way to disable the use of the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller in existing Kubernetes clusters created and managed by Kubernetes Engine (see [Using the Console to Disable the PodSecurityPolicy Admission Controller](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/ContEng/Tasks/contengusingpspswithoke.htm#contengusingpspswithoke_topic-Using_the_Console_to_Disable_the_PodSecurityPolicy_Admission_Controller)).
### Notes about Kubernetes Engine Support for Kubernetes Version 1.22
Note that Kubernetes version 1.22 stopped serving a number of deprecated Kubernetes APIs, including:
  * Webhook resources
  * CustomResourceDefinition
  * APIService
  * TokenReview
  * SubjectAccessReview resources
  * CertificateSigningRequest
  * Lease
  * Ingress
  * IngressClass
  * RBAC resources
  * PriorityClass
  * Storage resources

### Notes about Kubernetes Engine Support for Kubernetes Version 1.20 ðŸ”— 
With the announcement of support for Kubernetes version 1.20.8, the container runtime used by Kubernetes Engine changes from Docker to CRI-O. However, you don't have to change any of your existing Docker images because Docker images are Open Container Initiative (OCI) compliant. As far as Kubernetes is concerned, all OCI-compliant images look the same.
Note the following:
  * CRI-O is an implementation of the Kubernetes Container Runtime Interface (CRI), which enables the use of OCI-compatible runtimes. CRI-O can pull your existing Docker images and run them on your Kubernetes version 1.20.8 clusters.
  * When using the Docker runtime, the default configuration captures the standard output and standard error streams of containers using the JSON format. In contrast, CRI-O uses the Logrus format. If you use a logging tool such as Fluentd or Fluent Bit, update the tool's configuration to use a new parser to parse CRI logs. For example:
    * If you use Fluentd, use the [fluent-plugin-parser-cri parser](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-plugin-parser-cri#fluent-plugin-parser-cri).
    * If you use Fluent Bit, use the [Container Runtime Interface (CRI) parser](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/installation/kubernetes#container-runtime-interface-cri-parser).
  * You might have a workflow in a cluster that relies on the underlying docker socket /var/run/docker.sock (a pattern often referred to as Docker in Docker). Starting with Kubernetes version 1.20.8, such a workflow no longer functions.
  * If you previously used the Docker CLI to run commands on a host, you have to use crictl (a CLI for CRI-compatible container runtimes) instead. 
  * The upstream Kubernetes project is deprecating Docker as a container runtime after Kubernetes version 1.20.


To find out more:
  * See the [Kubernetes 1.20.8 Changelog](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.20.md#v1208) for more information about Kubernetes 1.20.8
  * See the [Dockershim Deprecation FAQ](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/12/02/dockershim-faq/) for more information about the deprecation of the dockershim adapter (which previously enabled the kubelet to interact with Docker as if Docker were a CRI-compatible runtime)
