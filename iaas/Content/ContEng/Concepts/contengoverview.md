# Overview of Kubernetes Engine (OKE)
_Find out about Kubernetes Engine (OKE), a fully-managed, scalable, and highly available service that enables you to deploy your containerized applications to the cloud._
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Kubernetes Engine is a fully-managed, scalable, and highly available service that you can use to deploy your containerized applications to the cloud. Use Kubernetes Engine (also known as Container Engine for Kubernetes, and sometimes abbreviated to just OKE) when your development team wants to reliably build, deploy, and manage cloud-native applications. You specify whether to run applications on virtual nodes or managed nodes, and Kubernetes Engine provisions them on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure in an existing OCI tenancy. 
Kubernetes Engine uses [Kubernetes](https://www.oracle.com/cloud-native/container-engine-kubernetes/what-is-kubernetes) - the open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications across clusters of hosts. Kubernetes groups the containers that make up an application into logical units (called pods) for easy management and discovery. Kubernetes Engine uses versions of Kubernetes certified as conformant by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://github.com/cncf/k8s-conformance). Kubernetes Engine is itself ISO-compliant (ISO-IEC 27001, 27017, 27018). 
You can access Kubernetes Engine to define and create Kubernetes clusters using the Console and the REST API. You can access the clusters you create using the Kubernetes command line (kubectl), the Kubernetes Dashboard, and the Kubernetes API.
Kubernetes Engine is integrated with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Identity and Access Management (IAM), which provides easy authentication with native Oracle Cloud Infrastructure identity functionality.
A number of related [Developer Tutorials](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/developer-tutorials/tutorials/home.htm#home__kubernetes) are available.
## Ways to Access Oracle Cloud Infrastructure ðŸ”— 
You can access Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) by using the [Console](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/GSG/Tasks/signingin_topic-Signing_In_for_the_First_Time.htm) (a browser-based interface), [REST API](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/usingapi.htm), or [OCI CLI](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/cliconcepts.htm). Instructions for using the Console, API, and CLI are included in topics throughout this documentation. For a list of available SDKs, see [Software Development Kits and Command Line Interface](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/sdks.htm).
To access the [Console](https://cloud.oracle.com/), you must use a [supported browser](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/GSG/Tasks/signinginIdentityDomain.htm#supported-browsers). To go to the Console sign-in page, open the navigation menu at the top of this page and select **Infrastructure Console**. You are prompted to enter your cloud tenant, your user name, and your password.
For general information about using the API, see [REST APIs](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/usingapi.htm).
## Creating Automation with Events ðŸ”— 
You can create automation based on state changes for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources by using event types, rules, and actions. For more information, see [Overview of Events](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Events/Concepts/eventsoverview.htm).
See [Kubernetes Engine](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Events/Reference/eventsproducers.htm#contengevents) for details about Kubernetes Engine resources that emit events.
## Resource Identifiers ðŸ”— 
Most types of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources have a unique, Oracle-assigned identifier called an Oracle Cloud ID (OCID). For information about the OCID format and other ways to identify your resources, see [Resource Identifiers](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm).
## Authentication and Authorization ðŸ”— 
Each service in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure integrates with IAM for authentication and authorization, for all interfaces (the Console, SDK or CLI, and REST API).
An administrator in an organization needs to set up **groups** , **compartments** , and **policies** that control which users can access which services, which resources, and the type of access. For example, the policies control who can create new users, create and manage the cloud network, create instances, create buckets, download objects, and so on. For more information, see [Managing Identity Domains](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/domains/overview.htm). For specific details about writing policies for each of the different services, see [Policy Reference](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Reference/policyreference.htm). 
If you're a regular user (not an administrator) who needs to use the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources that the company owns, contact an administrator to set up a user ID for you. The administrator can confirm which compartment or compartments you can use.
Note that to perform certain operations on clusters created by Kubernetes Engine, you might require additional permissions granted via a Kubernetes RBAC role or clusterrole. See [About Access Control and Kubernetes Engine (OKE)](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Concepts/contengaboutaccesscontrol.htm#About_Access_Control_and_Container_Engine_for_Kubernetes "Find out about the permissions required to access clusters you've created using Kubernetes Engine \(OKE\).").
## Kubernetes Engine Capabilities and Limits ðŸ”— 
Your account type (Monthly Universal Credits, Pay-as-You-Go, Promo) determines the number of clusters you can create in each region that is enabled for your tenancy, and the maximum number of nodes in each cluster. You can [contact us](https://support.oracle.com/) to request an increase to the number of enhanced clusters (but not to the number of basic clusters) that you can create in each region. See [Kubernetes Engine Limits](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/servicelimits.htm#Container_Engine_for_Kubernetes_Limits).
You can specify up to 110 pods to run on a single managed node in a node pool in a cluster. The limit of 110 is imposed by Kubernetes.
To set compartment-specific limits on a resource or resource family, administrators can use [compartment quotas](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Quotas/Concepts/resourcequotas.htm).
## Required IAM Service Policy ðŸ”— 
To use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, an administrator must be a member of a group granted security access in a **policy** by a tenancy administrator. This access is required whether you're using the Console or the REST API with an SDK, CLI, or other tool. If you get a message that you don't have permission or are unauthorized, verify with the tenancy administrator what type of access you have and which **compartment** your access works in.
If you're new to policies, see [Managing Identity Domains](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/domains/overview.htm) and [Common Policies](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/commonpolicies.htm).
