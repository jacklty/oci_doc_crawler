# Example Network Resource Configurations
_Find out about examples of how you might configure network resources for highly available cluster creation and deployment in a region with three availability domains when using Kubernetes Engine (OKE)._
When creating a new cluster, you can use the 'Quick Create' workflow to create new network resources automatically. Alternatively, you can use the 'Custom Create' workflow to explicitly specify existing network resources. For more information about the required network resources, see [Network Resource Configuration for Cluster Creation and Deployment](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Concepts/contengnetworkconfig.htm#Network_Resource_Configuration_for_Cluster_Creation_and_Deployment "Find out how to configure network resources to use Kubernetes Engine \(OKE\).").
This topic gives examples of how you might configure network resources when using the 'Custom Create' workflow to create highly available clusters in a region with three availability domains:

A number of related [Developer Tutorials](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/developer-tutorials/tutorials/home.htm#home__kubernetes) are available.
**Note** The examples in this section show the use of security rules in security lists to control access to clusters. If you prefer to use network security groups (which are recommended) over security lists, you can specify identical security rules for network security groups.
## Example 1: Cluster with Flannel CNI Plugin, Public Kubernetes API Endpoint, Private Worker Nodes, and Public Load Balancers ðŸ”— 
This example assumes you want the Kubernetes API endpoint and load balancers accessible directly from the internet. The worker nodes are accessible within the VCN.
Note that the Kubernetes API endpoint is assigned a private IP address by default. To expose the Kubernetes API endpoint to the internet, do both of the following:
  * Select a public subnet to host the Kubernetes API endpoint.
  * Specify that you want a public IP address assigned to the Kubernetes API endpoint (as well as the private IP address).


[![This image shows an example cluster configuration with a public Kubernetes API endpoint subnet, a private worker node subnet, public load balancer subnets, and a private bastion subnet. Access to the subnets is controlled by the seclist-KubernetesAPIendpoint, seclist-workernodes, seclist-loadbalancers, and seclist-Bastion security lists respectively. This cluster uses the flannel CNI plugin for pod networking. The Kubernetes API endpoint subnet is connected to the cluster control plane by a VNIC. Other features of this example configuration are described in the surrounding text.](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/images/conteng-network-flannel-eg1.png)](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/images/conteng-network-flannel-eg1.png)

## Example 4: Cluster with OCI CNI Plugin, Private Kubernetes API Endpoint, Private Worker Nodes, and Public Load Balancers ðŸ”— 
This example assumes you want only load balancers accessible directly from the internet. The Kubernetes API endpoint and the worker nodes are accessible within the VCN.
[![This image shows an example cluster configuration with a private Kubernetes API endpoint subnet, a private worker node subnet, public load balancer subnets, a private pods subnet, and a private bastion subnet. Access to the subnets is controlled by the seclist-KubernetesAPIendpoint, seclist-workernodes, seclist-loadbalancers, seclist-pods, and seclist-Bastion security lists respectively. This cluster uses the OCI CNI plugin for pod networking. The Kubernetes API endpoint subnet is connected to the cluster control plane by a VNIC. Other features of this example configuration are described in the surrounding text.](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/images/conteng-network-oci-cni-eg2.png)](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/images/conteng-network-oci-cni-eg2.png)
