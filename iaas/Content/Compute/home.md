#  Compute
Use the Compute service to create bare metal compute or virtual machine (VM) instances to deploy and run your applications.
[What's new](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/releasenotes/services/compute/)
#### Get Started
[Launching Your First Linux Instance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/tutorials/first-linux-instance/overview.htm "In this tutorial, perform the steps to create and connect to an OCI Compute instance. After your instance is up and running, optionally create and attach a block volume.")
[Launching Your First Windows Instance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/tutorials/first-windows-instance/overview.htm "In this tutorial, perform the steps to create and connect to an OCI Compute Windows instance. After your instance is up and running, optionally create and attach a block volume.")
[Working with Instances](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/instances.htm#instances "Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute lets you provision and manage compute hosts, known as instances. You can create instances as needed to meet your compute and application requirements. After you create an instance, you can access it securely from your computer, restart it, attach and detach volumes, and terminate it when you're done with it.")
[Compute shapes](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/computeshapes.htm#Compute_Shapes)
[High Performance Computing](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/high-performance-compute.htm#high-performance-compute "High Performance Computing \(HPC\) performs complex calculations and processes data faster than traditional Compute. HPC uses bare metal servers, ultralow latency cluster networking, high-performance storage options, and parallel file systems. This infrastructure enables parallel processing for compute-intensive workloads such as artificial intelligence, deep learning, data analysis, scientific simulations, and any other highly intensive workload.")
[Set up notifications](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/contextual-notifications-compute.htm#top "You can get messages when something happens with a compute instance. Use contextual notifications in the Console to create event rules and alarms for an instance. Quick start templates are available.")

#### Images and OSs
[Create a custom image](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/managingcustomimages.htm#Managing_Custom_Images "You can create a custom image of an instance's boot disk and use it to launch other instances. Instances you launch from your image include the customizations, configuration, and software installed when you created the image.")
[Export and import images across tenancies or regions](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/imageimportexport.htm#Image_ImportExport)
[Use a platform image](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/images.htm#OracleProvided_Images)
