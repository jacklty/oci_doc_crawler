## Before You Begin
To successfully complete this tutorial, you must have the following: 

Requirements
    
  * An [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Free Tier](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/FreeTier/freetier.htm) account or paid account.
  * A MacOS, Linux, or Windows computer with a Windows remote desktop client installed.


## Authentication and Authorization
Each service in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure integrates with IAM for authentication and authorization, for all interfaces (the Console, SDK or CLI, and REST API).
An administrator in an organization needs to set up **groups** , **compartments** , and **policies** that control which users can access which services, which resources, and the type of access. For example, the policies control who can create new users, create and manage the cloud network, create instances, create buckets, download objects, and so on. For more information, see [Managing Identity Domains](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/domains/overview.htm). For specific details about writing policies for each of the different services, see [Policy Reference](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Reference/policyreference.htm). 
If you're a regular user (not an administrator) who needs to use the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources that the company owns, contact an administrator to set up a user ID for you. The administrator can confirm which compartment or compartments you can use.
## 1. Create a Compartment ðŸ”— 
Compartments help you organize and control access to resources. A compartment is a collection of related resources (such as cloud networks, Compute instances, or block volumes). Only users in groups given permission by an administrator in your organization, have access to specific compartments. For example, one compartment could contain all the servers and storage volumes that make up the production version of a company's Human Resources system. Only users with permission to that compartment can manage those servers and volumes.
[Steps to Create a Compartment](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/tutorials/first-windows-instance/overview.htm)
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Compartments**. 
  2. Click **Create Compartment**. 
  3. Enter the following:
     * **Name:** Enter `<your-compartment-name>`
     * **Description** : Enter a description (required), for example: "`<your-compartment-name>` compartment for the getting started tutorial". Avoid entering confidential information.
     * **Parent Compartment:** Select the compartment you want this compartment to reside in. Defaults to the root compartment (or tenancy).
  4. Click **Create Compartment**.
Your compartment is displayed in the list.


When you select your compartment, you only see resources in that compartment. When you create new resources you select the compartment to create them in. The compartment control defaults to the last compartment selected.
## 2. Create a Virtual Cloud Network ðŸ”— 
Before you can launch an instance, create a virtual cloud network (VCN) and subnet to launch the instance into. A subnet is a subdivision of your VCN defined using a range of IP addresses with public or private access. The subnet directs traffic according to a **route table**. In addition, a subnet's security list controls traffic in and out of the instance. For this tutorial, access the instance over the internet using the instance's public IP address. The route table directs traffic to an internet gateway.
For information about VCN features, see [Networking Overview](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/overview.htm).
Use the **Start VCN Wizard** workflow to create a new Virtual Cloud Network (VCN). The workflow does several things when installing the VCN: 
  * Creates a VCN.
  * Adds an **Internet Gateway** which enables internet connections.
  * Creates and configures public and private subnets for the VCN.
  * Sets up route tables and security lists for the subnets.


For more information on VCNs, see: [VCN and Subnet Management](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/managingVCNs.htm).
[Steps to Create a VCN](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/tutorials/first-windows-instance/overview.htm)
To create a VCN, follow these steps:
**Important** The steps provided are for a Free Tier account. If you are using a paid account, the steps might differ from those shown here.
  1. Open the **navigation menu** , select **Networking** , and then select **Virtual cloud networks**.
  2. If needed, select the compartment you created in the preceding step from the compartments list in the left navigation.
  3. Click **Start VCN Wizard**.
  4. Select **Create VCN with Internet Connectivity**.
  5. Click **Start VCN Wizard**.
  6. Configure the VCN. The configure dialog contains the following sections. 
**Basic Information**
Enter the VCN **Name** and select a **Compartment**.
     * **Name:** `<name-for-the-vcn>`
Enter a name for your VCN. Avoid entering confidential information.
     * **Compartment:** `<your-compartment-name>`
Select your compartment.
**Configure VCN**
     * Keep the default values for **VCN IPv4 CIDR block** and **DNS resolution**.
**Configure public subnet**
     * Keep the default values for **IP address type** and **IPv4 CIDR block**.
**Configure private subnet**
     * Keep the default values for **IP address type** and **IPv4 CIDR block**.
  7. Click **Next**.
  8. Review you selections. Click **Previous** to go back and make changes.
  9. Click **Create** to create the VCN. 
The system creates the VCN and all its resources. This might take a moment.
After the creation is complete, click **View VCN** to see your new VCN.


[Edit the Default Security List to Allow Traffic to Your Windows Instance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/tutorials/first-windows-instance/overview.htm)
To enable network traffic to reach your Windows instance, you need to add a security list rule to enable Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access. Specifically, for the default security list (which is used by the public subnet), you need a stateful ingress rule for TCP traffic on destination port 3389 from source 0.0.0.0/0 and any source port.
**To edit the VCN's security list:**
  1. Click the name of the VCN that you just created. The VCN details are displayed.
  2. Under **Resources** , click **Security Lists**.
  3. Click the default security list for your VCN.
The security list details are displayed.
  4. Click **Add Ingress Rules**.
  5. Enter the following for your new rule:
    1. **Source Type:** CIDR
    2. **Source CIDR:** 0.0.0.0/0
    3. **IP Protocol:** RDP (TCP/3389)
    4. **Source Port Range:** All
    5. **Destination Port Range:** 3389
  6. When done, click **Add Ingress Rules**.


## 3. Create a Windows Virtual Machine Instance ðŸ”— 
Next, launch a Windows server instance with a basic shape. Use the **Create a VM Instance** workflow to create a new compute instance. The workflow does several things when installing the instance:
  * Creates and installs a compute instance running Windows Server.
  * Selects your VCN and public subnet to connect the Windows Server instance to the internet.
  * Creates a default password you use to connect to the instance.

  7. Press **Enter**.


**Note** The default user, `opc`, has administrative privileges.
## 5. (Optional) Add a Block Volume ðŸ”— 
Block Volume provides network storage to use with your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure instances. After you create, attach, and mount a volume to your instance, you can use it just as you would a physical hard drive on your computer. A volume can be attached to a single instance, but you can detach the volume from one instance and attach it to another instance, keeping your data intact.
For complete details on Block Volume, see [Overview of Block Volume](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Block/Concepts/overview.htm). 
[Create a Volume](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/tutorials/first-windows-instance/overview.htm)
