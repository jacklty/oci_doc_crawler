# Compute Shapes
A shape is a template that determines the number of **OCPUs** , amount of memory, and other resources that are allocated to an instance. Compute shapes are available with AMD processors, Intel processors, and Arm-based processors.
This topic provides basic information about the shapes that are available for bare metal instances, virtual machines (VMs), and dedicated virtual machine hosts. For information about service limits, see [Compute Limits](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/servicelimits.htm#computelimits). For information about protecting data on NVMe devices, see [Protecting Data on NVMe Devices](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/nvmedeviceinformation.htm#Protecting_Data_on_NVMe_Devices).
**Note**
  * When a new region becomes available, it might take a few weeks before host capacity also becomes available.
To obtain a list of shapes available to you, run the [ListShapes](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Shape/ListShapes) operation.
  * If your instance uses [stateful security rules](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm#stateful), each instance has a [maximum number of concurrent connections](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/servicelimits.htm#connection-tracking) that can be tracked, based on the instance's shape.


## Compute Shape Pricing ðŸ”— 
You can use the [Cost Estimator](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/cost-estimator.html) to estimate your expected monthly project costs with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. For detailed information about billing, see [Billing and Cost Management](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Billing/home.htm) and the Oracle Compute Cloud Services section of [Oracle PaaS and IaaS Universal Credits Service Descriptions](https://www.oracle.com/assets/paas-iaas-universal-credits-3940775.pdf). 

OCPUs and vCPUs
    
Oracle measures compute resource pricing differently. The Oracle CPU (OCPU) represents physical CPU cores and is the unit of measurement for CPUs on x86 CPUs (AMD and Intel) and Arm CPUs (OCI Ampere Compute). A virtual CPU (vCPU), the industry-standard for measuring compute resources, represents one execution thread of a physical CPU core.
Most CPU architectures, including x86, runs two threads per physical core, so one OCPU is the equal of two vCPUs for x86-based compute. For OCI Compute, the minimum unit of provisioning starts from one OCPU on both X86 (Intel and AMD) and OCI Ampere Compute processors. 
The following are the provisioning units for compute instances:
  * 1 OCPU on Arm A1 (Compute) = 1 core on Arm A1 (Compute) or 1 vCPU
  * 1 OCPU on Arm A2 (Compute) = 2 cores on Arm A2 (Compute) or 2 vCPUs
  * 1 OCPU on x86 (AMD and Intel) = 2 vCPUs


For more information, see [Cloud Price List](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/price-list.html#compute-vm). In addition, you can read this blog post on [vCPU and OCPU pricing information](https://blogs.oracle.com/cloud-infrastructure/post/vcpu-and-ocpu-pricing-information).
## Flexible Shapes ðŸ”— 
A flexible shape is a shape that lets you customize the number of OCPUs and the amount of memory when launching or resizing your VM. When you [create a VM instance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/launchinginstance.htm#top "Create a bare metal or virtual machine \(VM\) compute instance by using Compute service.") using a flexible shape, you select the number of OCPUs and the amount of memory that you need for the workloads that run on the instance. The network bandwidth and number of VNICs scale proportionately with the number of OCPUs. This flexibility lets you build VMs that match your workload, enabling you to optimize performance and minimize cost.
The flexible shapes are:
  * VM.Standard3.Flex (Intel)
  * VM.Standard.E4.Flex (AMD)
  * VM.Standard.E5.Flex (AMD)
  * VM.Standard.A1.Flex (Altra processor from Ampere)
  * VM.Standard.A2.Flex (AmpereOne processor from Ampere)
  * VM.DenseIO.E4.Flex (AMD)
  * VM.Optimized3.Flex (Intel)


Flexible memory is also available on flexible shapes. The amount of memory allowed is based on the number of OCPUs selected.
For [standard](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/computeshapes.htm#vm-standard) and [optimized](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/computeshapes.htm#vm-hpc-optimized) flexible shapes, the ratio of memory to OCPUs depends on the shape.
Shape | Maximum OCPUs | Minimum Memory | Maximum Memory  
---|---|---|---  
VM.Standard3.Flex | 32See [Extended Memory VM Instances](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/extended-memory-vm-instances.htm#extended-memory-vm-instances "Extended memory virtual machine \(VM\) instances are VM instances that provide more memory and cores than available with standard shapes."). | 1 GB or a value matching the number of OCPUs, whichever is greater | 64 GB per OCPU, up to 512 GB totalSee [Extended Memory VM Instances](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/extended-memory-vm-instances.htm#extended-memory-vm-instances "Extended memory virtual machine \(VM\) instances are VM instances that provide more memory and cores than available with standard shapes.").

VM.Standard.E5.Flex |  94 | 1 GB or a value matching the number of OCPUs, whichever is greater | 64 GB per OCPU, up to 1049 GB total  
VM.Standard.A1.Flex | 76 (OCPU is 1 core of an Altra processor) | 1 GB or a value matching the number of OCPUs, whichever is greater | 64 GB per OCPU, up to 472 GB total  
VM.Standard.A2.Flex | 78 (OCPU is 2 cores of an AmpereOne processor) | 1 GB or a value matching the number of OCPUs, whichever is greater | 64 GB per OCPU, up to 946 GB total  
VM.Optimized3.Flex | 18 | 1 GB or a value matching the number of OCPUs, whichever is greater | 64 GB per OCPU, up to 256 GB total  
For [dense I/O](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/computeshapes.htm#vm-dense) flexible shapes, the following configurations are available:
  * 8 OCPUs, 128 GB memory
  * 16 OCPUs, 256 GB memory
  * 32 OCPUs, 512 GB memory


These resources are billed at a per-second granularity with a one-minute minimum. Optimize your costs by choosing the shape that matches your workload and by changing the shape when your workload changes. For example, you can configure the VM to maximize compute processing power by choosing a low core-to-memory ratio. Or, for applications like in-memory databases or big data processing engines, configure an instance with a high core-to-memory ratio. Modify the OCPUs and memory as your workload changes, scaling up to increase performance or scaling down to reduce costs.
### Supported Images ðŸ”— 
Most [platform images](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/images.htm#OracleProvided_Images) are compatible with flexible shapes. Use a platform image that was published after the flexible shape was released (for release dates, see [the Compute release notes](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/releasenotes/services/compute/)).
Custom images are also supported, depending on the image. You must [add flexible shape compatibility to the custom image](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/managingcustomimages.htm#Managing_Custom_Images__console-custom-image-tasks), and then test the image on the flexible shape to ensure that it actually works on the shape.
### Supported Regions ðŸ”— 
For a list of supported regions, see the [compute instance service limits](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/servicelimits.htm#Compute_Instances). As host capacity becomes available in additional regions, the list is updated.
**Note** Capacity might be limited for A1 shapes.
## Extended Memory VM Instances ðŸ”—

  * [HPC and Optimized Shapes](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/computeshapes.htm#bm-hpc-optimized)


Network bandwidth is based on expected bandwidth for traffic within a VCN. To determine which [physical NICs are active for a shape](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/managingVNICs.htm#overview__How), refer to the network bandwidth specifications in the following tables. If the network bandwidth is listed as "2 x <bandwidth> Gbps," it means that both NIC 0 and NIC 1 are active.
For bare metal instances, optionally [configure advanced BIOS settings](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/bios-settings.htm#bios-settings "When you create a bare metal compute instance, you can optionally configure advanced BIOS settings that let you optimize performance. For example, you can disable simultaneous multithreading to optimize the NUMA settings."), such as disabling simultaneous multithreading, disabling cores, or optimizing the NUMA settings.

#### **C-States and Frequency Scaling** ðŸ”— 
Modern CPUs transition to a power-saving state (called c-states) when the CPU is idle or underutilized. These c-states start at C0, which is the normal CPU operating mode (the CPU is 100% activated). The higher the c-state, the deeper the sleep mode into which the CPU transitions. The sleep modes work by cutting the clock signal and power from idle units inside the CPU, thereby reducing the energy use. As the CPU transitions to higher c-states (deeper sleep states), the longer it takes to wake up the units that are shut down. This is an undesirable side effect of c-states transitions, because it can slow down a demanding application.
Fortunately, the hypervisor on standard VM shapes manages this complexity for the end user by preventing transitions to deeper sleep states even when the CPU is underutilized. In addition, it disables c-states when it sees sustained high utilization. When c-states are disabled, the CPU operates in C0 state, where all cores are active at base frequency. Each processor manufacturer names the maximum frequency per core differently; for Intel the maximum frequency is named max turbo frequency, and for AMD it is called max boost frequency. This maximum frequency is realized by the respective CPU's built-in algorithms when the processor is running in C0 state under normal but sustained load.
Currently, the hypervisor does not allow the client operating system running in the instance to manage the c-states using kernel command line options. The client always shows the base frequency, even when the hypervisor is running the processor at the maximum frequency advertised by the processor.

DVH.Optimized3.36 | X9-based optimized VM host | 36 | 32 | 512 | 472 | VM.Optimized3 series  
**Notes**
**1:** The difference between total and usable OCPUs and memory is caused by the need to reserve OCPUs and memory for hypervisor use.
**2:** Because this dedicated virtual machine host shape supports hosted VMs that use a [previous generation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/computeshapes.htm#previous-generation-shapes) shape series, it is available by request only.
**3:** For Standard2, Standard.E2, and DenseIO2 shapes, billing is based on OCPUs, not memory. For all other shapes that support flexible hosted VMs, billing is based on OCPUs and memory, which are billed independently.
## Previous Generation Shapes ðŸ”— 
**Tip** Previous generation shapes are still fully supported. However, because the underlying hardware has reached the sustaining phase of its lifecycle, capacity in certain high-demand regions might be limited.
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure periodically releases new generations of Compute shapes. The latest shapes let you take advantage of newer hardware and a better price-performance ratio. When a shape is several years old, and newer generation shapes that are suited for the same purposes are available, the old shape transitions to become a previous generation shape.
Your current utilization is fully supported on the previous generation shape. In certain high demand regions, you may need to plan your utilization growth on a newer generation shape.
### Upgrading from a Previous Generation Shape ðŸ”— 
To upgrade from a previous generation shape to a current generation shape, you can do the following things:
  * For supported VM instances, [change the shape of the instance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/resizinginstances.htm#Changing_the_Shape_of_an_Instance).
  * For bare metal instances and VM instances that don't support changing the shape, [terminate the instance but DO NOT delete the boot volume](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/terminatinginstance.htm#top "You can permanently delete \(terminate\) instances that you no longer need. Any attached VNICs and volumes are automatically detached when the instance terminates. Eventually, the instance's public and private IP addresses are released and become available for other instances."). Then, [use the boot volume to create a new instance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/launchinginstance.htm#top "Create a bare metal or virtual machine \(VM\) compute instance by using Compute service.").
