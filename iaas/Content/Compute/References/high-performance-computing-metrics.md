# High Performance Computing Metrics
Oracle Cloud Infrastruture provides specialized metrics to improve visibility into the performance of HPC instances.
HPC metrics are similar to standard compute instance metrics, however, the HPC metrics are available only on instances that have the HPC plugin with GPU and RDMA monitoring enabled and are located in the `gpu_infrastructure_health` and `rdma_infrastructure_health` customer namespaces. See [Compute Instance Metrics](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/computemetrics.htm#Compute_Instance_Metrics) for details on accessing and managing compute metrics.
## Available Metrics: gpu_infrastructure_health ðŸ”— 
The compute instance metrics help you measure the activity level and throughput of compute instances. The metrics listed in the following table are available for any [monitoring-enabled ](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/enablingmonitoring.htm#Enabling_Monitoring_for_Compute_Instances) compute instance. To get these metrics, enable monitoring on the instance.
The metrics in this namespace are aggregated across all the related resources on the instance. For example, `DiskBytesRead` is aggregated across all the instance's attached storage volumes, and `NetworkBytesIn` is aggregated across all the instance's attached VNICs.
For metrics emitted by the metric namespace `gpu_infrastructure_health`, data points are sampled every ten seconds. A batch of six of data points is emitted every minute. Therefore, for every minute granularity, the aggregate count is always six, the aggregate sum is the sum of the six data points, and the aggregate average is the average of the six data points.
You also can use the Monitoring service to create [custom queries](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Tasks/query-metric.htm).
Each metric includes the following **dimensions** : 

component
    GPU or rdma_nic 

timestamp
    UTC time when the payload/heartbeat is emitted 

version
    The payload version number for compatibility
Metric | Metric Display Name | Unit | Description | Dimensions  
---|---|---|---|---  
`GpuUtilization` | **GPU utilization** | percent |  Activity level from GPU. Expressed as a percentage of total time. For instance pools, the value is averaged across all instances in the pool. |  `availabilityDomain` `faultDomain` `gpuId` `imageId` `instancePoolId` `region` `resourceDisplayName` `resourceId` `shape`  
`GpuMemoryUtilization` | **GPU memory utilization** | percent | The percentage of the GPU memory resource in use.  
`GpuPowerDraw` | **GPU power draw** | integer | The amount of GPU power used.  
`GpuTemperature` | **GPU temperature** | integer | The GPU temperature reported.  
`GpuEccSingleBitErrors` | **GPU single-bit errors** | integer | The number of GPU single bit ECC errors reported.  
`GpuEccDoubleBitErrors` | **GPU double-bit errors** | integer | The number of GPU double bit ECC errors reported.  
1This metric is a cumulative counter that shows monotonically increasing behavior for each session of the Oracle Cloud Agent software, resetting when the operating system is restarted. 2The Networking service provides more metrics (in the `oci_vcn` metric namespace) for each [VNIC](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/managingVNICs.htm) on the instance. For more information, see [Networking Metrics](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Reference/networkmetrics.htm).  3The Block Volume service provides more metrics (in the `oci_blockstore` metric namespace) for each volume attached to the instance. For more information, see [Block Volume Metrics](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Block/References/volumemetrics.htm).   
### Fault Metrics: gpu_infrastructure_health
Metric | Metric Display Name | Unit | Description | Dimensions  
---|---|---|---|---  
`Fault` | **GPU fault** | count |  If the value is 0, there are no faults. If the value is 1, faults are detected. |  `availabilityDomain` `faultCode` `faultDomain` `gpuId` `imageId` `instancePoolId` `pcieAddress` `region` `resourceDisplayName` `resourceId` `shape`

## **High Performance Computing Policies** ðŸ”— 
**Create a dynamic group**
This example creates a group that contains all instances in a specific compartment.
```
Any {instance.compartment.id = '<compartment_ocid>'}
```

**Use Fault Management by OCI**
This example creates a policy that allows OCI to manage your faults.
```
Allow dynamic-group <group_name> to inspect all-resources in tenancy
```
or```
Allow dynamic-group <group_name> to inspect all-resources in compartment <compartment>
```
