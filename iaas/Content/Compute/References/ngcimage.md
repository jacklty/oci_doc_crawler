# Using NVIDIA GPU Cloud with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
NVIDIA GPU Cloud (NGC) is a GPU-accelerated cloud platform optimized for deep learning and scientific computing. This topic provides an overview of how to use NGC with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
NVIDIA makes available on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure a customized Compute image that is optimized for the NVIDIA Tesla Volta and Pascal GPUs. Running NGC containers on this instance provides optimum performance for deep learning jobs.
## Before You Begin ðŸ”— 
Prepare the following things:
  * An Oracle Cloud Infrastructure tenancy with a GPU quota. For more information about quotas, see [Compute Quotas](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Quotas/Concepts/resourcequotas_topic-Compute_Quotas.htm).
  * A cloud network to launch the instance in. For information about setting up cloud networks, see [Managing VCNs and Subnets](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/managingVCNs.htm) in [VCNs and Subnets](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/VCNs.htm).
  * A key pair, to use for connecting to the instance via SSH. For information about generating a key pair, see [Managing Key Pairs on Linux Instances](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/managingkeypairs.htm#Managing_Key_Pairs_on_Linux_Instances).
  * Security group and policy configured for the File Storage service. For more information, see [Managing Groups](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managinggroups.htm), [Managing Identity Domains](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/domains/overview.htm), and [Details for the File Storage Service](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Reference/filestoragepolicyreference.htm#Details_for_the_File_Storage_Service).
  * An NGC API key for authenticating with the NGC service.
[To generate your NGC API key](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/ngcimage.htm)
    1. Sign in to the [NGC website](https://ngc.nvidia.com/). 
    2. On the [NGC Registry page](https://ngc.nvidia.com/registry/), click **Get API Key**. 
    3. Click **Generate API Key** and then click **Confirm** to generate the key. If you have an existing API key it will become invalid once you generate a new key. 


## Launching an Instance Based on the NGC Image ðŸ”— 
### Using the Console ðŸ”— 
  1. Open the Console. For steps, see [Signing In for the First Time](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/GSG/Tasks/signingin_topic-Signing_In_for_the_First_Time.htm).
  2. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Compute**. Under **Compute** , select **Instances**.
  3. Select a **Compartment** that you have permission to work in.
  4. Click **Create instance**.
  5. Enter a name for the instance. Avoid entering confidential information.
  6. In the **Placement** section, select the **Availability Domain** that you want to create the instance in.
  7. In the **Image and shape** section:
    1. On the **Shape** card, click **Change shape**. Then, do the following:
      1. For **Instance type** , select **Virtual machine** or **Bare metal machine**. 
      2. Select a GPU shape for the instance. For more information about GPU shapes, see [virtual machine GPU shapes](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/computeshapes.htm#vm-gpu) and [bare metal GPU shapes](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/computeshapes.htm#bm-gpu).
**Important** In order to access the GPU shapes, your tenancy must have a GPU quota. If your tenancy does not have a GPU quota, the GPU shapes will not be in the shape list. See [Before You Begin](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/ngcimage.htm#prereq) for more information.
      3. Click **Select shape**.
    2. To select the NGC image, on the **Image** card, click **Change image**. Then do the following. 
**Important** In order to access the NVIDIA GPU Cloud images, your tenancy must have a GPU quota and you must select a GPU shape.
      1. In the **Image source** list, select **Oracle images**.
      2. Select the check box next to **NVIDIA GPU Cloud Machine Image**.
      3. Review and accept the terms of use, and then click **Select image**.
  8. In the **Networking** section, leave **Select existing virtual cloud network** selected, and then select the virtual cloud network (VCN) compartment, VCN, subnet compartment, and subnet.
  9. In the **Add SSH keys** section, upload the public key portion of the key pair that you want to use for SSH access to the instance. Browse to the key file that you want to upload, or drag and drop the file into the box.
  10. Click **Create**.


You should now see the NGC instance with the state of **Provisioning**. After the state changes to **Running** , you can connect to the instance. For general information about launching compute instances, see [Creating an Instance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/launchinginstance.htm#top "Create a bare metal or virtual machine \(VM\) compute instance by using Compute service.").
See the following topics for steps to access and work with the instance:
  * [Connecting to an Instance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/accessinginstance.htm#top "You can connect to a running compute instance by using a Secure Shell \(SSH\)Â or Remote Desktop connection.")
  * [Stopping, Starting, or Restarting an Instance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/restartinginstance.htm#top "You can stop, start, or restart an instance as needed to update software or resolve error conditions.")
  * [Terminating an Instance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/terminatinginstance.htm#top "You can permanently delete \(terminate\) instances that you no longer need. Any attached VNICs and volumes are automatically detached when the instance terminates. Eventually, the instance's public and private IP addresses are released and become available for other instances.")


When you connect to the instance using SSH, you are prompted for the NGC API key. If you supply the API key at the prompt, the instance automatically logs you in to the NGC container registry so that you can run containers from the registry. You can choose not to supply the API key at the prompt and still log in to the instance. You can then log in later to the NGC container registry. See [Logging in to the NGC Container Registry](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/ngcimage.htm#logon) for more information.
### Using the CLI ðŸ”— 
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure provides a [Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/cliconcepts.htm) you can use to complete tasks. For more information, see [Quickstart](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliinstall.htm) and [Configuring the CLI](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliconfigure.htm).
Use the [launch](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/tools/oci-cli/latest/oci_cli_docs/cmdref/compute/instance/launch.html) command to create an instance, specifying image for **sourceType** and the image OCID `ocid1.image.oc1..aaaaaaaaknl6phck7e3iuii4r4axpwhenw5qtnnsk3tqppajdjzb5nhoma3q` in **InstanceSourceDetails** for **LaunchInstanceDetails**.
## Using the File Storage Service for Persistent Data Storage ðŸ”— 
You can use the File Storage service for data storage when working with NGC. For more information, see [Overview of File Storage](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/File/Concepts/filestorageoverview.htm). See the following tasks for creating and working with the File Storage service:
  * [Creating File Systems](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/File/Tasks/creatingfilesystems.htm)
  * [Mounting File Systems](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/File/Tasks/mountingfilesystems.htm)
  * [Managing File Systems](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/File/Tasks/managingfilesystems.htm)


## Using the Block Volume Service for Persistent Data Storage ðŸ”— 
You can use the Block Volume service for data storage when working with NGC. For more information, see [Overview of Block Volume](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Block/Concepts/overview.htm). See the following tasks for creating and working with the Block Volume service:
  * [Creating a Block Volume](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Block/Tasks/creatingavolume.htm)

  * [Uploading an Object Storage Object to a Bucket](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/managingobjects_topic-To_upload_objects_to_a_bucket.htm)


You can also use the CLI to manage object storage, see the [os](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/tools/oci-cli/latest/oci_cli_docs/cmdref/os.html) command.
## Examples of Running Containers ðŸ”— 
You first need to log into the NGC container registry. You can skip this section if you provided your API key when logging into the instance via SSH. If you did not provide your API key when connecting to your instance, then you must perform this step.
[To log into the NGC container registry](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/ngcimage.htm)
  1. Run the following Docker command:
Copy
```
docker login nvcr.io
```

  2. When prompted for a username, enter `$oauthtoken`. 
  3. When prompted for a password enter your NGC API key. 


At this point you can run Docker commands and access the NGC container registry from the instance.
