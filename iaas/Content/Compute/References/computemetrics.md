# Compute Instance Metrics
You can monitor the health, capacity, and performance of your compute instances by using [metrics](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Concepts/monitoringoverview.htm#metrics), [alarms](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Concepts/monitoringoverview.htm#alarms), and [notifications](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Notification/home.htm).
This topic describes the metrics emitted by the metric namespace `oci_computeagent` (the Compute Instance Monitoring plugin on compute instances).
You can view these metrics for individual compute instances, and for all the instances in an instance pool.
Resources: [Monitoring-enabled](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/enablingmonitoring.htm#Enabling_Monitoring_for_Compute_Instances) compute instances.
## Overview of Metrics for an Instance and Related Resources ðŸ”— 
This section gives an overall picture of the different types of metrics available for an instance and its storage and network devices. See the following diagram and table for a summary.
[![This image shows the types of metrics available for an instance and related components.](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Resources/Images/compute_instance_overall_monitoring_metrics.png)](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Resources/Images/compute_instance_overall_monitoring_metrics.png)
Metric Namespace | Resource ID | Where Measured | Available Metrics  
---|---|---|---  
`oci_computeagent` | Instance OCID | On the instance. The metrics in this namespace are aggregated across all the related resources on the instance. For example, `DiskBytesRead` is aggregated across all the instance's attached storage volumes, and `NetworkBytesIn` is aggregated across all the instance's attached VNICs. |  See [Available Metrics: oci_computeagent](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/computemetrics.htm#Availabl).  
`oci_blockstore` | Boot or block volume OCID | By the Block Volume service. The metrics are for an individual volume (either boot volume or block volume). | See [Block Volume Metrics](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Block/References/volumemetrics.htm).  
`oci_vcn` | VNIC OCID | By the Networking service. The metrics are for an individual VNIC. |  See [VNIC Metrics](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Reference/vnicmetrics.htm).  
## Before You Begin ðŸ”— 
  * IAM policies: To monitor resources, you must be granted the required type of access in a **policy** written by an administrator, whether you're using the Console or the REST API with an SDK, CLI, or other tool. The policy must give you access to the monitoring services as well as the resources being monitored. If you try to perform an action and get a message that you don't have permission or are unauthorized, contact the administrator to find out what type of access you were granted and which **compartment** you need to work in. For more information about user authorizations for monitoring, see [IAM Policies](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Security/Reference/monitoring_security.htm#iam-policies).
  * Metrics exist in Monitoring: The resources that you want to monitor must emit metrics to the Monitoring service. 
  * Compute instances: To emit metrics, the Compute Instance Monitoring plugin must be enabled on the instance, and plugins must be running. The instance must also have either a service gateway or a public IP address to send metrics to the Monitoring service. For more information, see [Enabling Monitoring for Compute Instances](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/enablingmonitoring.htm). 


## Available Metrics: oci_computeagent ðŸ”— 
The compute instance metrics help you measure activity level and throughput of compute instances. The metrics listed in the following table are available for any [monitoring-enabled ](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/enablingmonitoring.htm#Enabling_Monitoring_for_Compute_Instances) compute instance. To get these metrics, enable monitoring on the instance.
The metrics in this namespace are aggregated across all the related resources on the instance. For example, `DiskBytesRead` is aggregated across all the instance's attached storage volumes, and `NetworkBytesIn` is aggregated across all the instance's attached VNICs. 
For metrics emitted by the metric namespace `oci_computeagent`, data points are sampled every ten seconds. A batch of six of data points is emitted every minute. Therefore, for every minute granularity, the aggregate count is always six, the aggregate sum is the sum of the six data points, and the aggregate average is the average of the six data points.
You also can use the Monitoring service to create [custom queries](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Tasks/query-metric.htm).
Each metric includes the following **dimensions** : 

availabilityDomain
    The **availability domain** where the instance resides. 

faultDomain
    The **fault domain** where the instance resides. 

imageId
    The OCID of the **image** for the instance.  

instancePoolId
    The [instance pool](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Concepts/instancemanagement.htm#Instance) that the instance belongs to.  

region
    The **region** where the instance resides. 

resourceDisplayName
    The friendly name of the instance.  

resourceId
    The **OCID** of the instance. 

shape
    The **shape** of the instance.

The Compute Instance Monitoring plugin is disabled on the instance or plugins are stopped. | Review the instance properties. | [Enable the Compute Instance Monitoring plugin and start all plugins](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/enablingmonitoring.htm).  
The instance can't access the Monitoring service because its VCN doesn't use the internet. | Review the instance's IP address. If it's not public, then a service gateway is needed.  | [Set up a service gateway](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/enablingmonitoring.htm#prerequisites).  
The instance doesn't use a supported image. | Review the [supported images](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/enablingmonitoring.htm#Availability).  | Create an instance with a [supported image](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/enablingmonitoring.htm#Availability).  
Older images and custom images: No Oracle Cloud Agent software exists on the instance.  | Connect to the instance and look for the software. | [Install the Oracle Cloud Agent software](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/manage-plugins.htm#install-agent).
