# Support Options for Microsoft Windows
[Oracle Support](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/GSG/Tasks/contactingsupport.htm) provides limited assistance for Microsoft Windows Server operating systems running on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and for SQL Server images provided by Oracle Cloud Marketplace. For product issues, work directly with [Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/).
## Microsoft Windows Server ðŸ”— 
Oracle Support provides limited assistance for Microsoft Windows Server operating systems running on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure as long as the Windows Server version has not reached end of support with Microsoft. For details about Microsoft Windows lifecycles, see [Lifecycle FAQ - Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/lifecycle/faq/windows).
In order for Oracle to provide support for Bring Your Own Image (BYOI) images, the images must follow the guidelines outlined in [Importing Custom Windows Images](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/importingcustomimagewindows.htm#Importing_Custom_Windows_Images) and must meet all [Microsoft licensing requirements](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/microsoftlicensing.htm#Microsoft_Licensing_on_Oracle_Cloud_Infrastructure).
Under these conditions, Oracle Support can help verify the following things:
  * The operating system boots
  * The operating system connects to the network
  * Attached storage connects and performs as expected


If you encounter other issues with Microsoft Windows Server, work directly with [Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/) to resolve the issue. Microsoft Support provides assistance when you have an existing Premier Support agreement or when you [pay for professional support](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/microsoft-professional-support-pay-per-incident-faq-575821bc-17bb-7484-4935-334c5437639f).
## SQL Server ðŸ”— 
Oracle Support provides limited assistance with SQL Server images provided by Oracle Cloud Marketplace. For product issues, work directly with [Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/).
For SQL Server images provided by Oracle Cloud Marketplace, Oracle Support can help verify that the services start and that they allow local connections.
The following tasks fall outside the scope of Oracle Support and should be addressed directly with Microsoft Support. Microsoft Support provides assistance when you have an existing Premier Support agreement or when you [pay for professional support](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/microsoft-professional-support-pay-per-incident-faq-575821bc-17bb-7484-4935-334c5437639f).
  * Query optimization
  * Failover clustering
  * Issues with third-party applications and with Microsoft applications that are not included in the Oracle Cloud Marketplace image. For example, _software fails to install_ errors.
  * Image configurations that diverge from Oracle's standard configurations. For example, requests such as _Roaming Profiles are going into read-only mode when our users log in via terminal server/RDS_ are out of scope.
  * Activities that breach the Microsoft license terms of use
