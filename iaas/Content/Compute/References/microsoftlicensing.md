# Microsoft Licensing on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
This topic provides information about the licensing requirements to use Microsoft products on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Oracle provides two options for using Windows Server licenses, OCI provided, and Microsoft bring your own license (BYOL).
**Important** Microsoft bring your own license is not available on Free Tier or trial tenancies.
## Using Microsoft Products on OCI
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure is licensed to provide Microsoft software offerings. Oracle is a member of the [Microsoft Partner Network](https://partner.microsoft.com), licensed to sell Microsoft software under the Service Provider License Agreement (SPLA). Oracle is also an authorized Microsoft Authorized Mobility Partner.
For the latest Microsoft licensing requirements, refer to the [Microsoft Product Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/).
If you can't find the answer to your question here, or you need more assistance running Microsoft products on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, contact [Oracle Support](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/GSG/Tasks/signingup_topic-Sign_Up_for_Free_Oracle_Cloud_Promotion.htm).
## Using Microsoft Windows Server Licenses on OCI ðŸ”— 
For Microsoft Windows Server on OCI, you can choose Microsoft BYOL or use an OCI provided Windows Server license. 

OCI Provided
    OCI provides the Windows Server licenses for the compute instance for a fee. See the [Oracle Cloud Price List: Operating Systems](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/price-list/#compute-os) for prices. 

Microsoft Bring Your Own License
    
With Microsoft BYOL, OCI customers can take advantage of their Microsoft Flexible Virtualization Benefit by using their own Microsoft Server subscription licenses or Software Assurance licenses. With this benefit, customers are no longer limited to dedicated hosts, now customers can leverage BYOL on shared infrastructure in the cloud. Converting from an OCI Provided license to a Microsoft Bring Your Own License will require customers to activate their own licenses. For more information on the Flexible Virtualization Benefit see: [Using software products under the Flexible Virtualization Benefit](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/documents/download/Licensing_guide_PLT_Flexible_Virtualization_Benefit_Nov2022.pdf).
All Microsoft licenses used at OCI must comply with the terms provided by Microsoft as described here: [Microsoft Licensing Use Rights](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/view/Licensing-Use-Rights). 
For instructions on how to launch instances with Windows Server, see: [Creating an Instance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/launchinginstance.htm#top "Create a bare metal or virtual machine \(VM\) compute instance by using Compute service.").
For instructions on how to change your Windows Server license type, by selecting either OCI Provided or Microsoft Bring Your Own License, see: [Changing the Windows License Type of an Instance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/changewinlicense.htm#changing_the_windows_license "When working with a Windows instance, you must select the type of license to use.").
### OCI License Models
The following table describes the licensing models that are available for using Microsoft Windows Server images on OCI.
Image | License | Additional Requirements  
---|---|---  
[Platform image](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/images.htm#OracleProvided_Images) | 
  * OCI provided
  * Microsoft BYOL

|  VM instances on a shared host, bare metal instances, and VM instances launched on a dedicated host are all permitted. For Microsoft BYOL, verify eligibility under the Flexible Virtualization Benefit.  
[Bring your own image (BYOI)](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/bringyourownimage.htm#Bring_Your_Own_Image_BYOI) | 
  * OCI provided
  * Microsoft BYOL

|  VM instances on a shared host and VM instances launched on a dedicated host are all permitted. For Microsoft BYOL, verify eligibility under the Flexible Virtualization Benefit.  
[Bring your own Hyper-V](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/bringyourownimage.htm#hypervisor) | 
  * Issued by Oracle

|  Instances must be launched on a dedicated host. [Create a bare metal instance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/launchinginstance.htm#top "Create a bare metal or virtual machine \(VM\) compute instance by using Compute service.") using the [Windows Server Datacenter platform image](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/images.htm#OracleProvided_Images). Then, copy your on-premises guest OS to Hyper-V on the bare metal instance.  
### Microsoft Windows Server Licensing FAQ ðŸ”— 
[What is Microsoft BYOL?](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/microsoftlicensing.htm)
Microsoft bring your own license (BYOL) lets you use Microsoft Server software licenses that you already own to deploy software on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, without any additional licensing fees.
Customers provide their own Microsoft Server subscription licenses or Software Assurance licenses and can use the new Flexible Virtualization Benefit. With the new benefit, customers are no longer limited to deploying on dedicated hosts, now customers can deploy to shared services in the cloud. The new benefit applies broadly to all products including Windows Server, desktop applications, developer tools and other server applications. For more information on the Flexible Virtualization Benefit see: [Using software products under the Flexible Virtualization Benefit](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/documents/download/Licensing_guide_PLT_Flexible_Virtualization_Benefit_Nov2022.pdf).

Yes, Windows Server 2022 is available as a [platform image](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/images.htm#OracleProvided_Images).
[Is Windows Server 2022 available as a Bring Your Own Image (BYOI) image?](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/microsoftlicensing.htm)
Yes, you can import your own Windows Server 2022 image for virtual machines only. For source image requirements and steps to import an image, see [Importing Custom Windows Images](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/importingcustomimagewindows.htm#Importing_Custom_Windows_Images).
[Does Oracle Cloud Infrastructure support Bring Your Own Image (BYOI) for Windows Server?](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/microsoftlicensing.htm)
Yes, you are permitted to import your own generalized custom image of Windows Server.
[How am I charged for Windows Server on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure?](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/microsoftlicensing.htm)
The cost of a Microsoft Windows Server license is an additional cost, on top of the underlying compute instance price. You pay separately for the compute instance and the Windows Server license. For more information about Microsoft Windows Server pricing, see [Compute Pricing](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/compute/pricing.html).
Billing for the Windows Server license is based on per-OCPU, per-second usage. Billing starts when an instance is in the "running" state and ends when you [terminate (delete) the instance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/terminatinginstance.htm#top "You can permanently delete \(terminate\) instances that you no longer need. Any attached VNICs and volumes are automatically detached when the instance terminates. Eventually, the instance's public and private IP addresses are released and become available for other instances.").
When an [instance is stopped](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/restartinginstance.htm#top "You can stop, start, or restart an instance as needed to update software or resolve error conditions."), billing for the Windows Server license depends on the [shape](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/computeshapes.htm#Compute_Shapes) that was used to create the instance. Billing pauses for instances that use a Standard shape or a shape in the VM.GPU.A10 series. Billing continues for instances that use a Dense I/O shape, HPC shape, or any other GPU shape.
Depending on the shape, you might also be [billed for the underlying compute instance when the instance is stopped](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/resource-billing-stopped-instances.htm#top "When you stop an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute instance, billing for the stopped instance depends on the shape that you used to create the instance.").
For Microsoft BYOL licensing, you will not be charged. See [Microsoft Licensing on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/microsoftlicensing.htm#Microsoft_Licensing_on_Oracle_Cloud_Infrastructure).
[How does Windows Server get updated with the latest patches?](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/microsoftlicensing.htm)
You must [update your VCN's security list](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securitylists.htm) to enable egress traffic for port 80 (HTTP) and port 443 (HTTPS) to install patches from Microsoft. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure enables automatic updates for Microsoft Windows Server and uses the default settings for applying Windows Server patches.
[Can I take a snapshot image after customizing a running Window Server instance?](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/microsoftlicensing.htm)
Yes, there are several options available:
  * [Create a custom image](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/windowsimages.htm#Creating_Windows_Custom_Images): Creates a custom image that you can use to launch other instances. Instances that you launch from your image include the customizations, configuration, and software installed when you created the image.
  * [Clone a boot volume](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Block/Tasks/cloningabootvolume.htm): Makes a copy of an existing boot volume without needing to go through the backup and restore process. A boot volume clone is a point-in-time direct disk-to-disk deep copy of the source boot volume, so all the data that is in the source boot volume when the clone is created is copied to the boot volume clone.
  * [Back up a block volume](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Block/Concepts/blockvolumebackups.htm): Makes a point-in-time backup of data on a block volume. You can restore a backup to a new volume either immediately after a backup or at a later time that you choose.
  * [Back up a boot volume](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Block/Tasks/backingupabootvolume.htm): Makes a backup of a boot volume. Boot volume backup capabilities are the same as block volume backup capabilities and are in-region only. Windows boot volume backups cannot be copied across regions.


[Can I export a custom Windows Server image?](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/microsoftlicensing.htm)
Yes, exporting custom Windows Server operating system images is supported. 
When exporting Windows-based images, you are responsible for complying with the [Microsoft Product Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/) and all product use conditions, as well as verifying your compliance with Microsoft.
For steps to export an image, see [Image Import/Export](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/imageimportexport.htm#Image_ImportExport).
[What support is available for Microsoft Windows Server on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure?](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/microsoftlicensing.htm)
[Oracle Support](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/GSG/Tasks/contactingsupport.htm) provides limited assistance for Microsoft Windows Server platform images if the Windows Server version has not reached end of support with Microsoft. All other Microsoft software is supported directly by [Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/).
Oracle Support can help verify that the operating system boots, that the operating system connects to the network, and that attached storage connects and performs as expected. If you encounter other issues with Microsoft Windows Server, work directly with Microsoft Support to resolve the issue. For more information, see [Support Options for Microsoft Windows](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/support_options_microsoft.htm#support_options_microsoft).
[How do I upgrade to a newer version of Windows Server?](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/microsoftlicensing.htm)
To upgrade to a newer version of Windows Server, you can do either of the following things:
  * Obtain the installation media from Microsoft or your Microsoft reseller, and then upgrade the existing compute instance. The license issued by Oracle Cloud Infrastructure remains in effect.
  * Create a new compute instance using the desired version of the Windows Server platform image, and then migrate your applications and data to the new instance.


[Can I change the license type of an instance based on a custom image that was incorrectly marked as Linux?](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/microsoftlicensing.htm)
Yes. Follow these steps change to a Windows Server license from a Linux custom image.
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Compute**. Under **Compute** , select **Custom Images**.
  2. Click the custom image that you're interested in.

  5. Select **Windows**. 
Next:
     * Select the Windows version.
     * Certify that you are following Windows license requirements.
  6. Click **Save changes**.


**Important** After saving the changes, follow these steps to complete the change. 
  1. Navigate back to the instance details page.
  2. Wait a couple of minutes for the change to take effect on instance detail page.
  3. Then edit the instance's Windows Server license as described here: [Changing the Windows License Type of an Instance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/changewinlicense.htm#changing_the_windows_license "When working with a Windows instance, you must select the type of license to use.")


[Are there user data capabilities when launching Windows Server images?](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/microsoftlicensing.htm)
Yes, [Windows Server platform images](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/images.htm#OracleProvided_Images) include cloudbase-init installed by default. You can use cloudbase-init to run PowerShell scripts, batch scripts, or other user data content on instance launch. Cloudbase-init is the equivalent of cloud-init on Linux-based images.
[Can I use Windows Remote Management on OCI?](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/microsoftlicensing.htm)
Yes, Microsoft Windows Remote Management (WinRM) is enabled by default on [Windows Server platform images](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/images.htm#OracleProvided_Images). WinRM enables you to remotely manage the operating system.
[What is Microsoft end of support?](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/microsoftlicensing.htm)
Microsoft establishes the support lifecycle policy for its products. When a product reaches the end of its support lifecycle, Microsoft no longer provides security updates for the product. You should upgrade to the latest version to remain secure.
[Can I use Windows Server 2012 R2 even though it's past the end-of-support date?](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/microsoftlicensing.htm)
Windows Server 2012 R2 reached the [end of its support life cycle](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/images.htm#lifecycle) on October 10, 2023. Although you can continue to import your own Windows 2012 R2 images and run your existing instances, you are at a higher risk of security issues, incompatibility, or failures. Oracle does not provide any operating system support for end-of-support operating systems. See [Operating System Lifecycle and Support Policy](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/images.htm#lifecycle)
OCI does not provide new platform images after the end-of-support date. However, you can import your own image and launch it on a shared host VM.
There are no restrictions to running end-of-support operating systems on bare metal machines on a dedicated host. You may bring your own image (BYOI) of a Windows Server 2012 R2 image, but you must import a custom OS image and run the image on a dedicated host.
[Can I purchase Microsoft Extended Security Updates for end-of-support Windows Server OSs?](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/microsoftlicensing.htm)
Yes, you can purchase Extended Security Updates (ESUs) from Microsoft for use on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
For VMs on shared infrastructure, you must have an enterprise agreement in place with Microsoft. With that agreement in place, you can purchase ESUs per virtual core matching the number of OCPUs per VM instance, with a minimum requirement of 16 virtual core licenses per VM instance.
For bare metal machines, you must have an enterprise agreement in place with Microsoft. With that agreement in place, you can purchase ESUs per physical core of the dedicated bare metal host.
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure cannot purchase ESUs on your behalf.
You are fully responsible for purchasing the correct number of ESUs for your instances. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure does not keep track of whether you have enough ESUs.
## Using Other Microsoft Software Licenses on OCI ðŸ”— 
With Microsoft BYOL, you can bring your own license for Microsoft software licenses subject to the [Microsoft Product Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/) and [Microsoft Flexible Virtualization Benefit](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/documents/download/Licensing_guide_PLT_Flexible_Virtualization_Benefit_Nov2022.pdf).

[How does pricing work for Microsoft SQL Server?](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/microsoftlicensing.htm)
**Important** Please ensure you understand the minimum billing requirement before launching a Microsoft SQL Server instance.
Charges for Windows Server and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute instances apply separately. Billing continues for Microsoft SQL Server Standard, Compute Instance and Windows Server License when the instance is stopped. To halt billing, you must terminate the instance (minimum still applies). 

Minimum 744 Hours Billing Requirement
    
If the Microsoft SQL Server instance is terminated within 744 hours of launch, billing for Microsoft SQL Server Standard, Compute Instance and Windows Server License continues until 744 hours are reached. After 744 hours, billing for Microsoft SQL Server Standard, Windows Server License and Compute instance stops when the instance is terminated. If multiple instances are terminated within 744 hours of launch, billing for Microsoft SQL Server Standard will continue for each instance until 744 hours are reached.
**Important** In effect, if you launch a Microsoft SQL Server instance you are billed for 744 hours of usage. Even if the instance is terminated immediately, you are still billed for 744 hours of usage.
**Total minimum Microsoft SQL Server Standard charges per each instance** can be calculated as follows: `Per hour price from Marketplace listing * Num OCPUs in Instance * 744`.
[Does my OCI Marketplace Microsoft SQL Enterprise license give me access to Power BI?](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/microsoftlicensing.htm)
