# Using Instance Configurations and Instance Pools
You can simplify the management of your compute instances using resources such as instance configurations and instance pools.
An instance configuration is a template that defines the settings to use when creating compute instances.
An instance pool is a set of instances that is managed as a group.
## Instance Configurations ðŸ”— 
An instance configuration defines the settings to use when creating compute instances, including details such as the base image, shape, and metadata. You can also specify the associated resources for the instance, such as block volume attachments and network configuration, and you can associate the instance with a [capacity reservation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/reserve-capacity.htm#reserve-capacity).
For steps to create an instance configuration, see [Creating an Instance Configuration](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/creatinginstanceconfig.htm#Creating_an_Instance_Configuration).
To modify an existing instance configuration, create a new instance configuration with the desired settings.
For steps to delete an instance configuration, see [Deleting Instance Configurations](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/deletinginstanceconfig.htm#Deleting_an_Instance_Configuration).
## Instance Pools ðŸ”— 
Instance pools let you create and manage multiple compute instances within the same region as a group. They also enable integration with other services, such as the Load Balancer service and IAM service.
You create an instance pool using an existing instance configuration.
After you have created an instance pool, you can update the size of the pool, add and remove existing instances from the pool, and attach or detach load balancers and network load balancers. You can also update the instance pool to use a different instance configuration, or to place instances in a different availability domain, fault domain, or subnet.
You can automatically adjust the number of instances in an instance pool based on performance metrics or a schedule. You can also stop and start instances in an instance pool based on a schedule. To do this, enable autoscaling for the instance pool.
A cluster network is a special kind of instance pool that is designed for massive, high-performance computing jobs.
For steps to manage instance pools, see the following topics:
  * [Creating Instance Pools](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/creatinginstancepool.htm#Creating_an_Instance_Pool)
  * [Updating Instance Pools](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/updatinginstancepool.htm#Updating_an_Instance_Pool "You can change the size of an instance pool, attach existing instances to a pool, attach load balancers and network load balancers, and update various other properties.")
  * [Stopping and Starting the Instances in an Instance Pool](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/restartinginstancepool.htm#Stopping_and_Starting_the_Instances_in_an_Instance_Pool "You can stop and start all the instances in an instance pool as needed to update software or resolve error conditions.")

### Instance Pool Lifecycle States ðŸ”— 
The following list describes the different lifecycle states for instance pools.
  * **Provisioning:** When you create an instance pool, this is the first state the instance pool is in. Instances for the instance pool are being configured based on the specified instance configuration. 
  * **Starting:** The instances are being launched. At this point, the only action you can take is to terminate the instance pool. 
  * **Running:** The instances are created and running. 
  * **Stopping:** The instances are in the process of being shut down. 
  * **Stopped:** The instances are shut down. 
  * **Scaling:** After an instance pool has been created, if you update the instance pool size, it will go into this state while creating instances (for increases in pool size) or terminating instances (for decreases in pool size). At this point, the only action you can take is to terminate the instance pool. 
  * **Terminating:** The instances and associated resources are being terminated. 
  * **Terminated:** The instance pool, all its instances and associated resources are terminated. 


## Distributing Instances Across Fault Domains for High Availability ðŸ”— 
By default, the instances in a pool are distributed across all [fault domains](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/regions.htm#fault) in a best-effort manner based on capacity. If capacity isn't available in one fault domain, the instances are placed in other fault domains to allow the instance pool to launch successfully.
In a high availability scenario, you can require that the instances in a pool are evenly distributed across each of the fault domains that you specify. When sufficient capacity isn't available in one of the fault domains, the instance pool doesn't launch or scale successfully, and a work request for the instance pool returns an "out of capacity" error. To fix the capacity error, either wait for capacity to become available, or [update the placement configuration](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/updatinginstancepool-updating-placement.htm#placement "Update the location where the instances in an instance pool are placed. The placement includes the availability domains, fault domains, and subnets for the instances in the instance pool.") (the availability domain and fault domain) for the instance pool.
## Limitations and Considerations ðŸ”— 
When working with instance configurations and instance pools, keep the following things in mind:
  * You cannot delete an instance configuration if it is associated with an instance pool.
  * You can use the same instance configuration for multiple instance pools. However, an instance pool can have only one instance configuration associated with it.
  * If an instance pool has been in the scaling or provisioning state for an extended period, the number of instances requested might exceed the number of instances available. In this scenario, after 24 hours, the instance pool transitions to **Running** with the available capacity, which might be less than the number of instances requested. The instance pool size updates to reflect the number of instances currently running.
    * When this happens, one of the following errors might appear in the work request: `ServiceLimit`, `OutOfCapacity`, `PostLaunchFailure`, or `InvalidParameter`.
    * If the number of instances exceeds your tenancy's service limits for that availability domain, you can [check your service limits](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/servicelimits.htm#To_view_your_tenancys_limits_and_usage_by_region) and [request a service limit increase](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/servicelimits.htm#Requesti).
  * If you modify the instance configuration for an instance pool, existing instances that are part of that pool don't change. Any new instances that are created after you modify the instance configuration use the new instance configuration. New instances are not created unless you increase the size of the instance pool or terminate existing instances.
  * If you decrease the size of an instance pool, to balance the instances across placements ([availability domain](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/regions.htm#About) and [fault domain](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/regions.htm#fault)), instances are terminated first based on how many instances from the instance pool are in that availability domain and fault domain. Within a placement, the oldest instances are terminated first.


## Required IAM Policy ðŸ”— 
To use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, an administrator must be a member of a group granted security access in a **policy** by a tenancy administrator. This access is required whether you're using the Console or the REST API with an SDK, CLI, or other tool. If you get a message that you don't have permission or are unauthorized, verify with the tenancy administrator what type of access you have and which **compartment** your access works in.
For administrators: For a typical policy that gives access to instance pools and instance configurations, see [Let users manage Compute instance configurations, instance pools, and cluster networks](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/commonpolicies.htm#manage-instance-pools).
## Tagging Resources ðŸ”— 
Apply tags to resources to help organize them according to business needs. Apply tags at the time you create a resource, or update the resource later with the wanted tags. For general information about applying tags, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).
### Propagation of Tagging on Resources ðŸ”— 
OCI services propagate all of a primary resource's freeform tags and defined tags to secondary resources when both resources support the type of tags. For example, when instance pools create instances, the tags from the instance pool and the instance configuration propagate to the resources created. Resources include instances created by the pool, primary VNICs, secondary VNICs, and boot volumes and block volumes created with the instance. Tags are not propagated to existing instances that are attached to the pool.
Sometimes, the tags on the instance pool, the instance configuration, and the resources might conflict. In those cases, the tag values from the instance configuration are propagated to the resources, overwriting both the instance pool and resource tag values. If the instance pool and resource tags conflict and the instance configuration doesn't have a tag, the tag values from the instance pool are propagated to the resources, overwriting the resource tag values.
