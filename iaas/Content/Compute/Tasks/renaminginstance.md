  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Compute**. Under **Compute** , select **Instances**.
  2. Click the instance that you're interested in.
  3. Select **More Actions** , and then select **Edit**.
  4. Enter a new name. Avoid entering confidential information.
  5. Click **Save changes**.


## Using the API ðŸ”— 
For information about using the API and signing requests, see [REST API documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/usingapi.htm) and [Security Credentials](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/credentials.htm). For information about SDKs, see [SDKs and the CLI](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/sdks.htm).
