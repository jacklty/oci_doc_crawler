# Connecting to an Instance
You can connect to a running compute instance by using a Secure Shell (SSH) or Remote Desktop connection.
For step-by-step instructions, see the following tasks:
  * [Connecting to a Linux Instance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/connect-to-linux-instance.htm#top "You can connect to a running Linux instance by using a Secure Shell \(SSH\) connection.")
  * [Connecting to a Windows Instance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/connect-to-windows-instance.htm#top "You connect to a Windows instance by using a Remote Desktop connection. Most Windows systems include a Remote Desktop client by default.")
  * [Connecting to an Instance on a Private Subnet Using a Bastion](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/connect-to-instance-private-subnet.htm#top "Use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Bastion to connect to compute instances that don't have public IP addresses.")
  * [Connecting to a Linux Instance using PuTTY and Windows](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/connect-to-linux-instance-from-windows-putty.htm#linux-from-windows-putty "PuTTY is a free implementation of SSH and Telnet for Windows. The program includes an xterm terminal emulator. PuTTY generates its own public and private SSH keys but can interoperate with OpenSSH keys.")
