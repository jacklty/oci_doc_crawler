# Oracle Cloud Agent
Oracle Cloud Agent is a lightweight process that manages plugins running on compute instances. Plugins collect performance metrics, install OS updates, and perform other instance management tasks.
To use plugins on an instance, the Oracle Cloud Agent software must be installed on the instance, the plugins must be enabled, and the plugins must be running. You might need to perform additional configuration tasks before you can use certain plugins.
## Supported Images ðŸ”— 
**Oracle Cloud Agent:** Oracle Cloud Agent is supported on current [platform images](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/images.htm#OracleProvided_Images) and on [custom images](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/bringyourownimage.htm#Bring_Your_Own_Image_BYOI) that are based on current platform images. Oracle Cloud Agent is installed by default on current platform images.
If you use an older platform image, you must manually install the Oracle Cloud Agent software. Select an image dated after November 15, 2018 (except Ubuntu, which must be dated after February 28, 2019).
You might have success manually installing Oracle Cloud Agent on other images, though it has not been tested on other operating systems and there is no guarantee that it will work.
**Plugins:** Plugins are installed as part of Oracle Cloud Agent. The plugins that are supported for an instance depend on the [version of Oracle Cloud Agent](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/manage-plugins.htm#Oracle_Cloud_Agent_software_versions) and on the image that you use to create the instance. To determine which plugins are supported for a particular image, use the Console to create an instance. Or, use the [ListInstanceagentAvailablePlugins](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/instanceagent/latest/Plugin/ListInstanceagentAvailablePlugins) API operation, providing the OS name and OS version of the image.
**Note** On Arm-based OCI Ampere A1 Compute shapes, the Custom Logs Monitoring plugin is not supported.
## Available Plugins ðŸ”— 
Each Oracle Cloud Agent plugin provides functionality related to compute instances. This functionality can enable features that are part of the Compute service, and features that are part of other services.
The following Oracle Cloud Agent plugins are available.
Plugin Name | Description | Steps to Configure and Use  
---|---|---  
`Bastion` | Allows secure shell (SSH) connections to an instance without public IP addresses using the Bastion service. | See [Bastion](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Bastion/Concepts/bastionoverview.htm).  
`Block Volume Management` | Configures Block Volume sessions for the instance. | See [Enabling the Block Volume Management Plugin](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Block/Tasks/enablingblockvolumemanagementplugin.htm) and [Attaching Ultra High Performance Volumes](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Block/Tasks/attachingavolume.htm#multipath).  
`Compute Instance Monitoring` | Emits metrics about the instance's health, capacity, and performance. These metrics are consumed by the Monitoring service. | See [Enabling Monitoring for Compute Instances](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/enablingmonitoring.htm#Enabling_Monitoring_for_Compute_Instances) and [Compute Instance Metrics](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/computemetrics.htm#Compute_Instance_Metrics).  
`Compute Instance Run Command` | Runs scripts within the instance to remotely configure, manage, and troubleshoot the instance. | See [Running Commands on an Instance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/runningcommands.htm#runningcommands).  
`Cloud Guard Workload Protection` | Allows you to manually manage updates to the Instance Security agent if you are running a custom image which doesn't have Oracle Cloud Agent (OCA) enabled. | See [Manually Updating the Instance Security Agent](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/cloud-guard/using/cgis-update-agent.htm).  
`Custom Logs Monitoring` | Ingests custom logs into the Logging service. | See [Custom Logs](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Logging/Concepts/custom_logs.htm).  
`High Performance Computing` | Performs complex calculations and processes data faster than traditional Compute. | See [High Performance Computing](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/high-performance-compute.htm#high-performance-compute "High Performance Computing \(HPC\) performs complex calculations and processes data faster than traditional Compute. HPC uses bare metal servers, ultralow latency cluster networking, high-performance storage options, and parallel file systems. This infrastructure enables parallel processing for compute-intensive workloads such as artificial intelligence, deep learning, data analysis, scientific simulations, and any other highly intensive workload.").  
`Management Agent` | Collects data from resources such as OSs, applications, and infrastructure resources for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services that are integrated with Management Agent. Data can include observability, log, configuration, capacity, and health data. | See [Deploy Management Agents on Compute Instances](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/management-agents/doc/management-agents-oracle-cloud-agent.html).  
`Oracle Autonomous Linux` | Manages autonomous updates and collects data associated with events, including logs and stack traces, for instances managed by the Autonomous Linux service.  | See [Oracle Autonomous Linux](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/os-management/osms/alx-index.htm).  
`Oracle Java Management Service` | Monitors Java deployments on instances managed by the Java Management service. | See [Java Management](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/jms/index.html).  
`OS Management Hub Agent` | Manage and monitor updates and patches for the operating system environment on the instance. | See [Registering an Instance with OS Management](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/osmh/doc/register-oci-instance.htm).  
`OS Management Service Agent` | Manage and monitor updates and patches for the operating system environment on the instance. | See [OS Management](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/os-management/home.htm).  
`Vulnerability Scanning` | Scans the instance for potential security vulnerabilities like OS packages that require updates. | See [Scanning Overview](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/scanning/using/overview.htm).  
## Required IAM Policy ðŸ”— 
To use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, an administrator must be a member of a group granted security access in a **policy** by a tenancy administrator. This access is required whether you're using the Console or the REST API with an SDK, CLI, or other tool. If you get a message that you don't have permission or are unauthorized, verify with the tenancy administrator what type of access you have and which **compartment** your access works in.
For administrators: The policy in [Let users launch compute instances](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/commonpolicies.htm#launch-instances) includes the ability to enable and disable individual plugins, as well as start and stop all plugins on an instance. If the specified group doesn't need to launch instances or attach volumes, you could simplify that policy to include only `manage instance-family`, and remove the statements involving `volume-family` and `virtual-network-family`. In addition, you must use the following policy to allow users to access the available plugins:
Copy
```
Allow group PluginUsers to read instance-agent-plugins in compartment ABC
```

If you're new to policies, see [Managing Identity Domains](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/domains/overview.htm) and [Common Policies](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/commonpolicies.htm). For reference material about writing policies for instances, cloud networks, or other Core Services API resources, see [Details for Core Services](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Reference/corepolicyreference.htm).

## Managing Plugins Using the Console ðŸ”— 
[To see which plugins are enabled for an instance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/manage-plugins.htm)
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Compute**. Under **Compute** , select **Instances**.
  2. Click the instance that you're interested in.
  3. Click the **Oracle Cloud Agent** tab.
The list of plugins is displayed. Enabled plugins can have the following statuses:
     * `RUNNING`: The plugin is running.
     * `STOPPED`: The plugin is stopped.
     * `NOT_SUPPORTED`: The plugin is not supported on this platform.
     * `INVALID`: The plugin status is not recognizable by the service.


[To enable or disable a plugin](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/manage-plugins.htm)
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Compute**. Under **Compute** , select **Instances**.
  2. Click the instance that you're interested in.
  3. Click the **Oracle Cloud Agent** tab.
  4. Toggle the **Enabled** or **Disabled** switch for the plugin.
**Caution** Functionality that depends on the plugin, such as monitoring, autoscaling, or OS management, will not work when the plugin is disabled.
It takes up to 10 minutes for the change to take effect.
  5. If you enabled a plugin, if necessary, perform any configuration tasks that are required before you can use the plugin. For information about how to configure each plugin, see the documentation for each plugin in [Available Plugins](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/manage-plugins.htm#available-plugins).


[To stop all plugins on an instance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/manage-plugins.htm)
You can stop all of the plugins that are running on an instance. Any individual plugins that are enabled on the instance remain enabled, but the plugin processes stop running. The plugin processes will only start running again after you restart all plugins.
For example, if you want to troubleshoot plugins, you can stop all plugins and then disable the plugins that you think might have an error. Reenable the plugins one-by-one, restarting the plugins after you enable each plugin, to determine which plugin has an issue. For more information about troubleshooting plugins, see [Troubleshooting Oracle Cloud Agent](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/manage-plugins-troubleshooting.htm#troubleshoot).
To stop all plugins on an instance:
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Compute**. Under **Compute** , select **Instances**.
  2. Click the instance that you're interested in.
  3. Click the **Oracle Cloud Agent** tab.
  4. Click **Stop plugins**.

  2. Click the instance that you're interested in.
  3. Click the **Oracle Cloud Agent** tab.
  4. Click **Start plugins**.
It takes up to 10 minutes for the plugins to restart.


## Managing Plugins Using the API ðŸ”— 
For information about using the API and signing requests, see [REST API documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/usingapi.htm) and [Security Credentials](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/credentials.htm). For information about SDKs, see [SDKs and the CLI](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/sdks.htm).
Use these API operations to manage Oracle Cloud Agent plugins:
  * In the Core Services API:
    * [LaunchInstance](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Instance/LaunchInstance) - enables or disables plugins, or stops all plugins, when you create an instance.
    * [GetInstance](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Instance/GetInstance) and [ListInstances](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Instance/ListInstances) - gets information about which plugins are enabled on an instance (or a list of instances).
    * [UpdateInstance](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Instance/UpdateInstance) - enables or disables individual plugins, and stops or starts all plugins, for an existing instance.
  * In the Oracle Cloud Agent API:
    * [ListInstanceagentAvailablePlugins](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/instanceagent/latest/Plugin/ListInstanceagentAvailablePlugins) - lists the plugins that are available for all instances. You can filter the results based on the image that you plan to use to launch an instance.
    * [ListInstanceAgentPlugins](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/instanceagent/latest/Plugin/ListInstanceAgentPlugins) - gets information about the plugins that are available on an existing compute instance.
    * [GetInstanceAgentPlugin](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/instanceagent/latest/Plugin/GetInstanceAgentPlugin) - gets information about a specific plugin on an existing compute instance.


## Updating the Oracle Cloud Agent Software ðŸ”— 
We recommend always running the latest version of the Oracle Cloud Agent software.
If the instance can access the internet, then no action is needed. Oracle Cloud Agent periodically checks for newer versions and installs the latest version when an update is available.
If the instance does not have access to the internet, then you must manually update the Oracle Cloud Agent software. For example, a compute instance cannot access the internet if it does not have a public IP address, internet gateway, or service gateway. In this situation, Oracle Cloud Agent cannot complete its checks for newer versions.
[To see which version of Oracle Cloud Agent is installed ](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/manage-plugins.htm)
[Connect to the instance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/accessinginstance.htm#top "You can connect to a running compute instance by using a Secure Shell \(SSH\)Â or Remote Desktop connection.") and then do one of the following things:
  * For Oracle Linux and CentOS, run the following command:
Copy
```
sudo yum info oracle-cloud-agent
```

  * For Oracle Linux Cloud Developer, run the following command:
Copy
```
rpm -qa | grep oracle-cloud-agent
```

  * For Ubuntu, run the following command:
Copy
```
snap info oracle-cloud-agent
```

  * For Windows, do one of the following things: 
    * In Control Panel, select **Programs and Features** and then find the version number provided for "Oracle Cloud Agent."
    * In PowerShell, run the following command:
Copy
```
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Product | Where-Object { $_.Name -eq "Oracle Cloud Agent" }
```

Example output:
```
IdentifyingNumber : {exampleuniqueidentifer}
Name       : Oracle Cloud Agent
Vendor      : Oracle Corporation
Version      : 0.0.10.0
Caption      : Oracle Cloud Agent
```



[To manually update Oracle Cloud Agent on a compute instance ](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/manage-plugins.htm)
Do one of the following things:
  * Temporarily allow the instance to access the internet so that Oracle Cloud Agent can update itself.
  * Redo [the installation steps](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/manage-plugins.htm#install-agent), using the latest version.
