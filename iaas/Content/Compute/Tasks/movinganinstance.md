# Live, Reboot, and Manual Migration: Moving a Compute Instance to a New Host
This topic provides information about maintenance actions that involve relocating virtual machine (VM) and bare metal instances during [infrastructure maintenance events](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/infrastructure-maintenance.htm#infrastructure-maintenance). Available actions include:
  * [Live Migration](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/movinganinstance.htm#live-migration)
  * [Reboot Migration](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/movinganinstance.htm#reboot)
  * [Moving an Instance with Manual Migration](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/movinganinstance.htm#manual)


**Important** For information about when a virtual machine needs to be migrated, see [Infrastructure Maintenance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/infrastructure-maintenance.htm#infrastructure-maintenance). 
**Tip** **Dedicated virtual machine host migration:** For information about how to relocate dedicated virtual machine hosts during infrastructure maintenance events, see [Managing Maintenance Reboot Migration for Dedicated Virtual Machine Hosts](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Concepts/dedicatedvmhosts_topic-infrastructure-maintenance.htm#dvmh-maintenance "Dedicated virtual machine host instances might require migration because of scheduled or unscheduled maintenance for the host. Customers are notified by a notification message or by a console message when viewing the dedicated virtual machine host. In this case, you can migrate all the instances from a source host to a destination host. Depending on the type of planned maintenance, you might be able to extend the maintenance due date. The notification indicates whether you can extend the maintenance due date."). 
**Note** **Oracle Platform Services:** For instances that were created with [Oracle Platform Services](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Reference/PaaSprereqs.htm) and located in the compartment `ManagedCompartmentForPaaS`, you must use the interface for the specific Platform Service to reboot the instances. 
## Live Migration ðŸ”— 
Live Migration is a mechanism for moving a VM from one physical server to another while the VM is still running. During a live migration, the source VM instance continues to run as the Compute service copies memory and all virtual components to the new target VM instance. When the copy is complete, there is only a slight pause, typically measured in tens of milliseconds, when the system switches to the new VM.
During an [infrastructure maintenance event](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/infrastructure-maintenance.htm#planned-maintenance__recovering-an-instance), Oracle Cloud Infrastructure live migrates supported VM instances from a healthy physical VM host that needs maintenance to a healthy VM host with minimal disruption to running instances.
If an instance cannot be live migrated, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure schedules a due date for reboot migration within 14 to 16 days and sends you a notification. If you do not proactively reboot the instance before the due date, the instance is reboot migrated for you.
By default, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure live migrates the instance without sending any notification about the upcoming maintenance. When a live migration begins and ends, an [infrastructure maintenance event](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Events/Reference/eventsproducers.htm#computeevents__compute_instance) is emitted. You can [use automation to track infrastructure maintenance events](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Events/Concepts/eventsgetstarted.htm).
### Live Migration Support ðŸ”— 
When you [create an instance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/launchinginstance.htm#top "Create a bare metal or virtual machine \(VM\) compute instance by using Compute service."), select settings that are compatible with live migration. For an existing instance, where supported, you can enable live migration by editing the instance to use settings that are compatible with live migration. Some settings that are incompatible with live migration cannot be edited after you create an instance.
The following table shows the criteria that make an instance compatible with live migration. All criteria must be met for an instance to support live migration.
Category | Criteria that support live migration | Can setting be edited after creating the instance?  
---|---|---  
Realm | Tenancy is in the [commercial realm](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/regions.htm). | No.  
Shape |  Instance uses one of the following [shapes](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/computeshapes.htm#Compute_Shapes):
  * VM.Standard1 series
  * VM.Standard.A1.Flex
  * VM.Standard.B1 series
  * VM.Standard2 series
  * VM.Standard3.Flex
  * VM.Standard.E2 series
  * VM.Standard.E2.1.Micro
  * VM.Standard.E3.Flex
  * VM.Standard.E4.Flex
  * VM.Standard.E5.Flex
  * VM.Optimized3.Flex

Other VM shapes, bare metal instances, and instances on dedicated virtual machine hosts do not support live migration. |  Yes, for some shapes. [Change the shape of the instance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/resizinginstances.htm#Changing_the_Shape_of_an_Instance) to a supported shape. Alternatively, [terminate (delete) the instance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/terminatinginstance.htm#top "You can permanently delete \(terminate\) instances that you no longer need. Any attached VNICs and volumes are automatically detached when the instance terminates. Eventually, the instance's public and private IP addresses are released and become available for other instances."), but do _not_ delete the associated boot volume. Then, use the boot volume to [create a new instance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/launchinginstance.htm#top "Create a bare metal or virtual machine \(VM\) compute instance by using Compute service.") using a shape that supports live migration.  
Image |  Instances that use Linux or Windows [platform images](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/images.htm#OracleProvided_Images) support live migration. For instances that use [custom images](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/managingcustomimages.htm#Managing_Custom_Images "You can create a custom image of an instance's boot disk and use it to launch other instances. Instances you launch from your image include the customizations, configuration, and software installed when you created the image.") or Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Marketplace images, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure attempts to live migrate the instance. | No.  
Networking launch type | Instance uses [paravirtualized networking](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/recommended-networking-launch-types.htm#top "When you create a VM instance, by default, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure chooses a recommended networking type for the VNIC based on the instance shape and OS image. The networking interface handles functions such as disk input/output and network communication."). | Yes, [edit the networking launch type](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/edit-launch-options.htm#edit-launch-options).  
Shielded instances | Not supported. | No.  
Windows Defender Credential Guard is enabled | Not supported. | No.  
Virtual network interface cards (VNICs) | Maximum total number of attached VNICs is six. | Yes, [detach and delete secondary VNICs](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/managingVNICs.htm#To3) until six or fewer VNICs total are attached.  
To determine whether an instance supports live migration:
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Compute**. Under **Compute** , select **Instances**.
  2. Select the instance that you're interested in.
  3. Check the **Live migration** field for the instance. If the field displays **View incompatibilities** , the instance doesn't support live migration.
  4. (Optional) To see which settings are not compatible with live migration, click **View incompatibilities**.


## Reboot Migration ðŸ”— 
With reboot migration, the instance is stopped, migrated to a healthy host, and restarted. A short downtime occurs during the migration. You can control when the downtime occurs by proactively reboot migrating the instance before the maintenance due date.
Reboot migration is supported for VM instances that use standard, GPU, and dense I/O shapes, and for bare metal instances that use standard shapes. The default maintenance action depends on the instance [shape](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/computeshapes.htm#Compute_Shapes).
  * VM instances:
    * **Standard/GPU shapes (including Flex):** Within 24 hours after the maintenance due date, the VM instance is stopped, migrated to a healthy host, and restarted. A short downtime occurs during the migration.
You can control when the downtime occurs by proactively reboot migrating the instance before the maintenance due date.
    * **DenseIO shapes (including Flex):** On the maintenance due date, the VM instance is stopped, rebuilt, and restarted. A downtime of several hours occurs during the maintenance process.
If you want to minimize downtime and can delete the locally-attached NVMe-based SSD, you can proactively reboot the instance before the scheduled maintenance time. The instance will be reboot migrated to a healthy host and the SSD will be permanently deleted. A short downtime occurs during the migration.
  * Bare metal instances:
    * **Standard shapes:** Within 24 hours after the maintenance due date, the bare metal instance is stopped, migrated to a healthy host, and restarted. A short downtime occurs during the migration.
You can control when the downtime occurs by proactively reboot migrating the instance before the maintenance due date.
If reboot migration is unsuccessful, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure sends a notification. You must manually migrate the instance to a healthy host.


After the instance is reboot migrated, the **Maintenance reboot** field is cleared. This change indicates that the instance was moved successfully. 
**Important** Use the Console, CLI, or SDK to reboot migrate a VM instance. Rebooting the instance from the operating system does not migrate the instance to new hardware.
After a migration, by default the instance is recovered to the same lifecycle state as before the maintenance event. If you have an alternate process to recover the instance after a reboot migration, you can configure the instance to remain stopped after it is migrated to healthy hardware. For more information about configuring migration options, including the lifecycle state of instances after a migration, see [Setting Instance Availability During Maintenance Events](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/edit-maintenance-recovery-action.htm#edit-maintenance-recovery-action).
**Tip** You can extend the due date for reboot migration, see [Extending Maintenance Deadline](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/infrastructure-maintenance.htm#planned-maintenance__extending-deadline)
### Prerequisites for Reboot Migration ðŸ”— 
Prepare the instance for reboot migration:
  * Ensure that any block volumes defined in `/etc/fstab` use the [recommended options](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Block/References/fstaboptions.htm).
  * Ensure that any File Storage service (NFS) mounts use the `nofail` option.
  * If you use the [Oracle-provided script](https://github.com/oracle/terraform-examples/blob/master/examples/oci/connect_vcns_using_multiple_vnics/scripts/secondary_vnic_all_configure.sh) to configure secondary VNICs, ensure it runs automatically at startup.
  * If the instance uses a dense I/O shape, back up the locally-attached NVMe-based SSD:
    1. [Create](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Block/Tasks/creatingavolume.htm) and [attach](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Block/Tasks/attachingavolume.htm) one or more block volumes to the instance.
    2. Copy the data from the NVMe devices to the block volumes.


### Moving a VM Instance with Reboot Migration ðŸ”— 
After you complete the [prerequisites](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/movinganinstance.htm#prerequisites-reboot):
  1. Stop any running applications.
  2. Use the Console, CLI, or SDK to [reboot the instance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/restartinginstance.htm#top "You can stop, start, or restart an instance as needed to update software or resolve error conditions."). Reboot migration is _not_ performed when you restart the instance from the operating system.
If the instance uses a dense I/O [shape](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/computeshapes.htm#Compute_Shapes):
     * **Using the Console:** In the **Reboot instance** dialog box, select the **Delete the local NVMe-based SSD and reboot migrate to a healthy host** option.
     * **Using the CLI or SDK:** In the [InstanceAction](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Instance/InstanceAction) operation, set the `allowDenseRebootMigration` attribute to `true`.
**Caution** For dense I/O instances, the NVMe-based SSD is permanently deleted. We recommend that you create a backup of the SSD before proceeding.
  3. Confirm that the maintenance event in the **Maintenance** tab is in the `Succeeded` state. (There are three possible final states: `Succeeded`, `Canceled`, `Failed`).
  4. Start and test any applications on the instance.
  5. For dense I/O instances, if you want to restore the NVMe-based SSD:
    1. [Attach the block volumes](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Block/Tasks/attachingavolume.htm) used to back up local NVMe devices.
    2. Copy the data onto the NVMe storage on the new instance.
    3. [Detach](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Block/Tasks/detachingavolume.htm) and optionally [delete](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Block/Tasks/deletingavolume.htm) the block volumes.


### Moving a Bare Metal Instance with Reboot Migration ðŸ”— 
After you complete the [prerequisites](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/movinganinstance.htm#prerequisites-reboot):
  1. Stop any running applications.
  2. Use the Console, CLI, or SDK to [reboot the instance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/restartinginstance.htm#top "You can stop, start, or restart an instance as needed to update software or resolve error conditions."). Reboot migration is _not_ performed when you restart the instance from the operating system.
     * **Using the Console:** In the **Reboot instance** dialog box, select the **Reboot migrate the instance to a healthy host** option.
     * **Using the CLI or SDK:** In the [InstanceAction](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Instance/InstanceAction) operation, pass the value `REBOOTMIGRATE` as the action to perform. To reboot migrate the instance immediately, leave the `timeScheduled` attribute empty.
  3. Confirm that the maintenance event in the **Maintenance** tab is in the `Succeeded` state. (There are three possible final states: `Succeeded`, `Canceled`, `Failed`).
  4. Start and test any applications on the instance.


## Moving an Instance with Manual Migration ðŸ”— 
For instances without a date in the **Maintenance reboot** field (available in the Console, CLI, and SDKs), you must move the instance manually. This method requires that you delete (terminate) the instance, and then launch a new instance from the retained boot volume. Instances that have additional VNICs, secondary IP addresses, remote attached block volumes, the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) enabled, or that belong to a backend set of a load balancer require additional steps.
### Limitations and Warnings for Manual Migration ðŸ”— 
Be aware of the following limitations and warnings when performing a manual migration:
  * Any public IP addresses assigned to your instance from a [reserved public pool](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/assign-public-ip-instance-launch.htm) are retained. Any that were not assigned from a reserved public IP address pool will change. Private IP addresses do not change.
  * MAC addresses, CPUIDs, and other unique hardware identifiers do change during the move. If any applications running on the instance use these identifiers for licensing or other purposes, be sure to take note of this information before moving the instance to help you manage the change.
  * Shielded instances have additional limitations. See [Migrating Shielded Instances](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/shielded-instances.htm#migrate).


### Prerequisites for Manual Migration ðŸ”— 
  1. Before moving the instance, document all critical details:
     * The instance's region, availability domain, and fault domain.
     * The instance's display name.
     * All private IP addresses, names, and subnets. Note that the instance can have multiple VNICs, and each VNIC can have multiple secondary IP addresses. 
     * All private DNS names. The instance can have multiple VNICs, and each VNIC can have multiple secondary IP addresses. Each private IP address can have a DNS name.
     * Any [public IP addresses](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/managingpublicIPs.htm) assigned from a reserved public pool. Note that the instance can have multiple VNICs, and each VNIC can have multiple secondary private IP addresses. Each VNIC and secondary private IP address can have an attached public IP address.
     * Any block volumes attached to the instance.
     * Any tags on the instance or attached resources.
  2. Prepare the instance for manual migration:
     * Ensure that any block volumes defined in `/etc/fstab` use the [recommended options](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Block/References/fstaboptions.htm).
     * Ensure that any File Storage service (NFS) mounts use the `nofail` option.
     * If you have statically defined any network interfaces belonging to secondary VNICs using their MAC addresses, such as those defined in `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg*`, those interfaces will not start due to the change in the MAC address. Remove the static mapping.
     * If you use the [Oracle-provided script](https://github.com/oracle/terraform-examples/blob/master/examples/oci/connect_vcns_using_multiple_vnics/scripts/secondary_vnic_all_configure.sh) to configure secondary VNICs, ensure it runs automatically at startup.


### Moving an Instance Manually ðŸ”— 
After you complete the prerequisites, perform the following steps.
  1. Stop any running applications.
  2. Ensure that those applications will not start automatically.
**Caution** When the relocated instance starts for the first time, any block volumes, secondary VNICs, or any resource that relies on them, will not be attached. The absence of these resources can cause application issues.
  3. If the instance uses a dense I/O [shape](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/computeshapes.htm#Compute_Shapes), back up the locally-attached NVMe-based SSD:
    1. [Create](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Block/Tasks/creatingavolume.htm) and [attach](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Block/Tasks/attachingavolume.htm) one or more block volumes to the instance.
    2. Copy the data from the NVMe devices to the block volumes.
  4. Unmount any [block volumes](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Block/Tasks/disconnectingfromavolume.htm) or File Storage [service (NFS) mounts](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/File/Tasks/mountingfilesystems.htm).
  5. [Back up all block volumes](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Block/Concepts/blockvolumebackups.htm).
  6. [Create a backup of the boot volume](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Block/Concepts/bootvolumebackups.htm).
**Important** Do not generalize or specialize Windows instances.
  7. Terminate (delete) the instance, preserving the attached boot volume:
[Using the Console](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/movinganinstance.htm)
Follow the steps in [Terminating an Instance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/terminatinginstance.htm#top "You can permanently delete \(terminate\) instances that you no longer need. Any attached VNICs and volumes are automatically detached when the instance terminates. Eventually, the instance's public and private IP addresses are released and become available for other instances."), ensuring that the **Permanently delete the attached boot volume** check box is cleared. This preserves the boot volume that is associated with the instance.
[Using the API](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/movinganinstance.htm)
Use the [TerminateInstance](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Instance/TerminateInstance) operation and pass the `preserveBootVolume` parameter set to `true` in the request. 
[Using the CLI](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/movinganinstance.htm)
Use the [instance terminate](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/tools/oci-cli/latest/oci_cli_docs/cmdref/compute/instance/terminate.html) operation and set the `preserve-boot-volume` option to `true`.
  8. [Create a new instance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/launchinginstance.htm#top "Create a bare metal or virtual machine \(VM\) compute instance by using Compute service.") using the boot volume from the terminated instance.
(Optional) If the instance is on a new dedicated virtual machine host:
     * In the **Placement** section, click **Show advanced options**.
     * For **Capacity type** , select **Dedicated host**.
     * Select the dedicated virtual machine host that you want to place the instance on.
In the create instance flow, specify the private IP address that was attached to the primary VNIC. If the public IP address was assigned from a reserved IP address pool, be sure to assign the same IP address.
  9. When the instance state changes to **Running** , [stop the instance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/restartinginstance.htm#top "You can stop, start, or restart an instance as needed to update software or resolve error conditions.").
  10. Recreate any [secondary VNICs](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/managingVNICs.htm) and [secondary IP addresses](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/ipaddressesanddns.htm).
  11. [Attach any block volumes](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Block/Tasks/attachingavolume.htm).
**Note** This step includes any volumes used to back up local NVMe devices. Copy the data onto the NVMe storage on the new instance, and then detach the volumes.
  12. [Start the instance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/restartinginstance.htm#top "You can stop, start, or restart an instance as needed to update software or resolve error conditions.").
  13. Start and test any applications on the instance.
  14. Configure the applications to start automatically, as required.
  15. [Recreate the required tags](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).
  16. (Optional) After you confirm that the instance and applications are healthy, you can delete the volume backups.
