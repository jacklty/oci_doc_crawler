# Displaying the Console History for an Instance
You can capture and display recent serial console data for an instance. The data includes configuration messages that occur when the instance boots, such as kernel and BIOS messages, and is useful for checking the status of the instance or diagnosing and troubleshooting problems.
The console history captures up to a megabyte of the most recent serial console data for the specified instance. Note that the _raw_ console data, including multi-byte characters, is captured.
The console history is a point-in-time record. To troubleshoot a malfunctioning instance using an interactive console connection, use a [serial console connection or a VNC console connection](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/serialconsole.htm#Instance_Console_Connections).
## Required IAM Policy ðŸ”— 
To use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, an administrator must be a member of a group granted security access in a **policy** by a tenancy administrator. This access is required whether you're using the Console or the REST API with an SDK, CLI, or other tool. If you get a message that you don't have permission or are unauthorized, verify with the tenancy administrator what type of access you have and which **compartment** your access works in.
For administrators: The policy in [Let users launch compute instances](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/commonpolicies.htm#launch-instances) includes the ability to manage console history data. If the specified group doesn't need to launch instances or attach volumes, you could simplify that policy to include only `manage instance-family`, and remove the statements involving `volume-family` and `virtual-network-family`.
## Tagging Resources ðŸ”— 
Apply tags to resources to help organize them according to business needs. Apply tags at the time you create a resource, or update the resource later with the wanted tags. For general information about applying tags, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).
## Managing Console History Data ðŸ”— 
You can use the Console, CLI, or API to manage console history captures. Console history lets you see serial output from your instance without having to connect to the instance remotely. You can use this information to troubleshoot instance access issues.
### Using the Console ðŸ”— 
On the instance details page in the Console, you can capture and download console histories, view and edit metadata details, and delete console history captures.
[To capture the console history](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/displayingconsole.htm)
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Compute**. Under **Compute** , select **Instances**.
  2. Click the instance that you're interested in.
  3. Under **Resources** , click **Console history**.
  4. Click **View current history**.
  5. Enter an optional name for the console history. Avoid entering confidential information.
  6. **Show tagging options:** If you have permissions to create a resource, then you also have permissions to apply free-form tags to that resource. To apply a defined tag, you must have permissions to use the tag namespace. For more information about tagging, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). If you're not sure whether to apply tags, skip this option or ask an administrator. You can apply tags later.
  7. To download a copy of the console history, click **Download**.
  8. Click **Save and close**.
