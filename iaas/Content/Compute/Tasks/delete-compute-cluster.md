# Deleting a Compute Cluster
You can delete a compute cluster if you no longer need it.
Before you delete a compute cluster, first [delete all instances in the cluster](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/terminatinginstance.htm#top "You can permanently delete \(terminate\) instances that you no longer need. Any attached VNICs and volumes are automatically detached when the instance terminates. Eventually, the instance's public and private IP addresses are released and become available for other instances.").
## Required IAM Policy ðŸ”— 
To use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, an administrator must be a member of a group granted security access in a **policy** by a tenancy administrator. This access is required whether you're using the Console or the REST API with an SDK, CLI, or other tool. If you get a message that you don't have permission or are unauthorized, verify with the tenancy administrator what type of access you have and which **compartment** your access works in.
For administrators: To allow users to do all things with compute clusters in all compartments, write the following policy:
Copy
```
Allow group ComputeClusterUsers to manage compute-clusters in tenancy
```

You must also allow users to create instances in cluster networks. For a typical policy, see [Let users launch compute instances](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/commonpolicies.htm#launch-instances).
## Using the Console ðŸ”— 
  1. Open the navigation menu and click **Compute**. Under **Compute** , click **Compute Clusters**.
  2. Click the compute cluster that you're interested in.
  3. Click **Delete** , and then confirm when prompted.


## Using the API ðŸ”— 
Use the [DeleteComputeCluster](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/ComputeCluster/DeleteComputeCluster) operation.
## Using the CLI ðŸ”— 
Use the [compute-cluster delete](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/tools/oci-cli/latest/oci_cli_docs/cmdref/compute/compute-cluster/delete.html) command.
Command
CopyTry It
```
oci compute compute-cluster delete --compute-cluster-id <compute_cluster_OCID>
```

For information about using the CLI, see [Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/cliconcepts.htm).
