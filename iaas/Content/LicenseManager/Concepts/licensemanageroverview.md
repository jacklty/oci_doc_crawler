# License Manager
License Manager is a free, opt-in service that allows you to bring your own licenses (BYOL) into Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
Use License Manager to:
  * Automate the license portability rules for Oracle Database products to OCI Database PaaS services. This eliminates overhead for Software Asset Managers (SAMs) and developers in an enterprise. Developers can create BYOL Oracle Database resources, such as Autonomous Database, without needing to worry about creating visibility into their infrastructure for their SAM. A resource can be _BYOL_ , which means Oracles charges you for infrastructure, but not licensing fees for software running on it. A resource can also be _license included_ , which means the cost includes infrastructure and the software licensing fee.
  * Track license usage for Oracle Database products or third-party products by Compute resources. As a result, you have a single observation and license usage tracking location of all Oracle and third-party licenses in OCI. 
  * Obtain reporting of BYOL resources that have licensing needs. Monitor and manage a list of email addresses to be notified about the expiration or over-subscription of licenses.


## Supported Products ðŸ”— 
License Manager supports the following Oracle products and options:
  * Oracle Database Enterprise Edition
  * Oracle Database Standard Edition
  * Oracle Database Standard Edition One
  * Oracle Database Standard Edition 2
  * Real Application Clusters
  * Multitenant
  * Active Data Guard


## Required IAM Policy ðŸ”— 
To use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, an administrator must be a member of a group granted security access in a **policy** by a tenancy administrator. This access is required whether you're using the Console or the REST API with an SDK, CLI, or other tool. If you get a message that you don't have permission or are unauthorized, verify with the tenancy administrator what type of access you have and which **compartment** your access works in.
If you're new to policies, see [Getting Started with Policies](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm#Getting_Started_with_Policies) and [Common Policies](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/commonpolicies.htm#top). 
To use License Manager, the following policy statements are required:
```
ALLOW GROUP <Group Name> to Manage licensemanager-settings in tenancy
ALLOW GROUP <Group Name> to Manage licensemanager-record in tenancy
```

## Authentication and Authorization ðŸ”— 
Each service in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure integrates with IAM for authentication and authorization, for all interfaces (the Console, SDK or CLI, and REST API).
An administrator in an organization needs to set up **groups** , **compartments** , and **policies** that control which users can access which services, which resources, and the type of access. For example, the policies control who can create new users, create and manage the cloud network, create instances, create buckets, download objects, and so on. For more information, see [Managing Identity Domains](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/domains/overview.htm). For specific details about writing policies for each of the different services, see [Policy Reference](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Reference/policyreference.htm). 
If you're a regular user (not an administrator) who needs to use the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources that the company owns, contact an administrator to set up a user ID for you. The administrator can confirm which compartment or compartments you can use.
## Viewing License Summary Activity  ðŸ”— 
The License Manager **Overview** page provides an overall summary of your license activity. The page allows you to get quick insights into your most utilized licenses, Bring Your Own License (BYOL) resources needing the most licenses by OCPUs and ECPUs, an overall count of BYOL and license included resources, and licenses at or near expiration.
To view the **Overview** page and its details, open the navigation menu and click ****Governance & Administration****. Under **License Management** , click **Overview**. The License Manager **Overview** page opens.
The top of the page has tiles to indicate the totals for:
  * **Product Licenses** : The total number of product licenses.
  * **BYOL Resources** : The total number of BYOL resources. Corresponds to what is listed in the **Top BYOL resources by OCPUs** and **Top BYOL resources by ECPUs** tables.
  * **License Included Resources** : The count of license-included Database PaaS resources you have created in the tenancy.
  * **Licenses at or near expiration** : The total number of license records within 90 days of expiration.


Following the totals summary, the **Top Utilized Product Licenses** table displays the following:
  * **Product License** : The product license name. Click the linked name to go to its [details](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/LicenseManager/Concepts/licensemanageroverview.htm#licensemanager-viewlicense_details "You can view the list of licenses and product license details from the Product Licenses page.") page.
  * **Status** : The license status, which can be the following:
    * **Ok** : The license has active license records for Oracle products, and active license records and an image associated for third-party licenses.
    * **Incomplete** : The Oracle product license was created without any active license records within it. For third-party products, the status is **Incomplete** if there aren't any active records or images associated with the license.
    * **Issues Found** : Over-subscribed licenses. The license requirement exceeds the entitlement.
    * **Warning** : Shown for license records when all licensing requirements (mandatory options or base product licenses) aren't found in License Manager. **Warning** is also shown if data hasn't been updated in more than 24 hours.
  * **Requirement** : What all the resources attributed to a license need, to be considered fully licensed. The licensing requirement is calculated every hour.
  * **Entitlement** : The sum of all license counts in your license records.
  * **Metric** : The metric that matches your licensing terms.


The **Top BYOL resources by OCPUs** table lists the following:
  * **Resource OCID** : Click the link to go directly to the BYOL resource.
  * **OCPUs** : The total number of OCPUs used by the BYOL resource.

  * **Resource OCID** : Click the link to go directly to the BYOL resource.
  * **ECPUs** : The total number of ECPUs used by the BYOL resource.
  * **Compartment** : The associated compartment.


## Adding a License ðŸ”— 
You can view and add licenses from the **Product Licenses** page. Licenses are defined in terms of their requirements and entitlements, according to the metric the license is created for. 
You can create either Oracle or third-party licenses. Adding third-party licenses is similar to the process of adding Oracle products, however, you are restricted to OCPUs as the only metric. Work with your third-party vendor to better understand how a licensing term translates.
From the **Product Licenses** page you can view the overall list of product licenses, and view, add, import, or delete product licenses. The page lists the following:
  * **Product License** : Click the linked product license name to go to the [license details](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/LicenseManager/Concepts/licensemanageroverview.htm#licensemanager-viewlicense_details "You can view the list of licenses and product license details from the Product Licenses page.") page, or select **View** from the Actions menu.
  * **Status** : The license status. 
    * **Ok**
    * **Incomplete**
    * **Issues Found**
    * **Warning**
