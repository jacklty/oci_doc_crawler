# Amazon Web Services Cognito
This document describes how to configure OCI IAM with identity domains to integrate with Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cognito.
## Before You Begin ðŸ”— 
Read about the AWS Cognito application as well as learn what information you need before getting started.
### About AWS Cognito ðŸ”— 
Amazon Cognito lets you add user sign-up, sign-in, and access control to your web and mobile apps quickly and easily. Amazon Cognito scales to millions of users and supports sign-in with social identity providers, such as Apple, Facebook, Google, and Amazon, and enterprise identity providers via SAML 2.0 and OpenID Connect.
In Cognito, we can create multiple userpools and each userpool can hold users, groups and manage different sign-ins. An integration with AWS Cognito is directly with a single userpool. Customer can have multiple userpools under a single Cognito account.
### What Do You Need? ðŸ”— 
To create an AWS account, you need:
  * A **paid** Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) account, or an OCI trial account. See [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Free Tier](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/FreeTier/freetier.htm#Oracle_Cloud_Infrastructure_Free_Tier).
  * OCI administrator sign-in credentials
  * AWS IAM administrator sign-in credentials
  * AWS Cognito UserPool Access


To create an application in OCI identity, you need:
  * Identity domain administrator or security administrator role for the OCI IAM identity domain. See [Understanding Administrator Roles](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/roles/understand-administrator-roles.htm#understand-administrator-roles).
  * The following AWS cognito configuration information:
    * AccessKeyId
    * SecretAccessKey
    * External ID
    * Role ARN
    * Account Region
    * Cognito User Pool Id
    * (Optional) List of Group Names from which one wants to synchronize users


## Supported Operations ðŸ”— 
Operation| Supported| Comments  
---|---|---  
Test Connectivity| yes| Tests the connectivity and configuration provided.  
Authoritative Sync (Full)| yes| Sync users , groups and user-group memberships from AWS Cognito and creates them in OCI Identity Domain.  
Incremental Authoritative Sync| no| AWS Cognito doesn't support for incremental or delta changes of users , groups , user-group memberships.  
## Creating an AWS Account ðŸ”— 
  1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console with your administrator privileges.
  2. Go to **Services** , **Security & Identity** and select **IAM**.


### Create a Policy for Accessing Cognito APIs ðŸ”—
