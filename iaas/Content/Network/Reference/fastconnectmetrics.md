# FastConnect Metrics
You can monitor the health, capacity, and performance of your [FastConnect connection](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnect.htm#FC_landing "Oracle Cloud Infrastructure FastConnect provides an easy way to create a dedicated, private connection between your data center and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.") by using metrics, alarms, and notifications. For more information, see [Monitoring](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/home.htm) and [Notifications](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Notification/home.htm). 
This topic describes the metrics emitted by the metric namespace `oci_fastconnect`.
Resources: cross-connect groups, virtual circuits
## Overview of Metrics: oci_fastconnect ðŸ”— 
Metrics are available for multiple resources in the FastConnect connection. The metrics help you determine quickly whether your FastConnect connection is up, how much data is flowing over the connection, and whether packets are being dropped for unexpected errors.
FastConnect offers different [connectivity models:](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectoverview.htm#How)
  * [Connect with an Oracle partner](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectprovider.htm#FastConnect_With_an_Oracle_Partner "This topic is for customers who want to use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure FastConnect by connecting to an Oracle Partner."): Metrics are available for virtual circuits in the connection.
  * [Connect with a third-party provider](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectthirdpartyprovider.htm#FastConnect_With_a_ThirdParty_Provider "This topic is for customers who want to use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure FastConnect by connecting to a third-party network provider of their choice, and not an Oracle Partner."): Metrics are available for the cross-connect group (LAG) and virtual circuits in the connection. Metrics for cross-connects will be available in a future release.
  * [Colocate with Oracle](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectcolocate.htm#FastConnect_Colocation_with_Oracle "This topic is for customers who are colocated with Oracle in a FastConnect location."): Metrics are available for the cross-connect group (LAG) and virtual circuits in the connection. Metrics for cross-connects will be available in a future release.


A cross-connect group (LAG) contains one or more cross-connects. If there are multiple and one goes down, the cross-connect group stays up, but the group might experience a lower overall bandwidth. 
### Required IAM Policy
To monitor resources, you must be granted the required type of access in a **policy** written by an administrator, whether you're using the Console or the REST API with an SDK, CLI, or other tool. The policy must give you access to both the monitoring services and the resources being monitored. If you try to perform an action and get a message that you don't have permission or are unauthorized, contact the administrator to find out what type of access you were granted and which **compartment** you need to work in. For more information about user authorizations for monitoring, see [IAM Policies](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Security/Reference/monitoring_security.htm#iam-policies). 
## Available Metrics: oci_fastconnect ðŸ”— 
The metrics listed in the following table are automatically available for each virtual circuit or cross-connect group that you create. You do not need to enable monitoring to get these metrics.
You also can use the Monitoring service to create custom queries. See [Building Metric Queries](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Tasks/buildingqueries.htm).
Each metric includes the following dimensions:  

COMPONENT
    Possible values are `crossconnectgroup`, `crossconnect`, and `virtualcircuit`. If you [connect through an Oracle partner](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectprovider.htm#FastConnect_With_an_Oracle_Partner "This topic is for customers who want to use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure FastConnect by connecting to an Oracle Partner."), only the `virtualcircuit` component is available. 

RESOURCEID
    The **OCID** of the resource (either a cross-connect group, cross-connect, or virtual circuit).  

RESOURCENAME
    The name given to the resource.
Metric | Metric Display Name | Unit | Description | Dimensions  
---|---|---|---|---  
`BitsReceived ` |  **Bits Received** |  Bits |  Number of bits received on the FastConnect interface at the Oracle end of the connection.  For a cross-connect group (LAG), the value is the sum across all cross-connects in the group. |  `component` `resourceId ` `resourceName `  
`BitsSent ` |  **Bits Sent** |  Bits |  Number of bits sent from the FastConnect interface at the Oracle end of the connection.  For a cross-connect group (LAG), the value is the sum across all cross-connects in the group.  
`BytesReceived` |  **Bytes Received** |  Bytes |  Number of bytes received on the FastConnect interface at the Oracle end of the connection.  For a cross-connect group (LAG), the value is the sum across all cross-connects in the group.  
`BytesSent` |  **Bytes Sent** |  Bytes |  Number of bytes sent from the FastConnect interface at the Oracle end of the connection.  For a cross-connect group (LAG), the value is the sum across all cross-connects in the group.  
`ConnectionState` |  **Connection State** |  Binary (1 or 0) |  The values are up (1) or down (0).  For a virtual circuit, the operational state of the virtual circuit's interface. For a cross-connect group, this reflects the overall operational state of the cross-connects that make up the cross-connect group (LAG). If at least one of the cross-connects is up, this value is up (1). If _all_ the cross-connects in the group are down, this value is down (0).   
`PacketsError` |  **Packets with Errors** |  Packets |  Number of packets dropped at the Oracle end of the connection. Dropped packets indicate a misconfiguration in some part of the overall system. Check if there's been a change to the configuration of your VCN, the virtual circuit, or your CPE.  For a cross-connect group (LAG), the value is the sum across all cross-connects in the group.  
`PacketsDiscarded` | **Packets Discarded** | Packets | Number of packets discarded at the Oracle end of the connection.  
`PacketsReceived` |  **Packets Received** |  Packets |  Number of packets received on the FastConnect interface at the Oracle end of the connection.  For a cross-connect group (LAG), the value is the sum across all cross-connects in the group.  
`PacketsSent` |  **Packets Sent** |  Packets |  Number of packets sent from the FastConnect interface at the Oracle end of the connection.  For a cross-connect group (LAG), the value is the sum across all cross-connects in the group.  
`Ipv4BgpSessionState` | **IPv4 BGP Session State** | Binary (1 or 0) | The values are up (1) or down (0). The status of the IPv4 BGP session for a virtual circuit.  
`Ipv6BgpSessionState` | **IPv6 BGP Session State** | Binary (1 or 0) | The values are up (1) or down (0). The status of the IPv6 BGP session for a virtual circuit.  
## Using the Console ðŸ”— 
The instructions depend on which FastConnect [connectivity model](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectoverview.htm#How) you use.
### If You Use an Oracle Partner
[To view default metric charts for a single FastConnect connection](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Reference/fastconnectmetrics.htm)
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Networking**. Under **Customer connectivity** , select **FastConnect**.
  2. Click the connection you're interested in.
  3. The default metrics charts for the connection's virtual circuit are displayed on the resulting page. 


For more information about monitoring metrics and using alarms, see [Overview of Monitoring](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Concepts/monitoringoverview.htm). For information about notifications for alarms, see [Overview of Notifications](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Notification/Concepts/notificationoverview.htm).
[To view default metric charts for all FastConnect connections in a compartment](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Reference/fastconnectmetrics.htm)
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Observability & Management**. Under **Monitoring** , select **Service Metrics**. 
  2. For **Compartment** , select the compartment that you're interested in.
  3. For **Metric namespace** , select **oci_fastconnect**.
The **Service Metrics** page dynamically updates the page to show charts for each metric that is emitted by the selected metric namespace. 


If there are multiple FastConnect connections in the compartment, by default the charts show a separate line for each one (each virtual circuit). 
For more information about monitoring metrics and using alarms, see [Overview of Monitoring](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Concepts/monitoringoverview.htm). For information about notifications for alarms, see [Overview of Notifications](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Notification/Concepts/notificationoverview.htm).
#### If You Use a Third-Party Provider or Colocate with Oracle
In this situation, you manage both the physical connection (cross-connects) and logical connection (virtual circuit). 
For the physical connection, metrics are available for the cross-connect group (LAG), but not the individual cross-connects. If you are using only a single cross-connect with no cross-connect group, then no metrics are available for the physical connection.
For the logical connection, metrics are available for each virtual circuit.
[To view default metric charts for a single FastConnect connection](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Reference/fastconnectmetrics.htm)
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Networking**. Under **Customer connectivity** , select **FastConnect**.
  2. Click the connection you're interested in.
  3. View the metrics for the resource you're interested in:
     * For a cross-connect group: Under **Resources** , click **Metrics**. The default metrics charts are displayed on the resulting page.
     * For a virtual circuit:
       1. Under **Resources** , click **Virtual Circuits**.
       2. Click the virtual circuit you're interested in. If it's a private virtual circuit, the default metrics charts are displayed on the resulting page. If it's a public virtual circuit, click **Metrics** to view the charts.
