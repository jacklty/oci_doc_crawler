# Networking Metrics
You can monitor the health, capacity, and performance of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources by using metrics, alarms, and notifications. For more information, see [Monitoring](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/home.htm) and [Notifications](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Notification/home.htm). 
Monitoring service metric namespaces related to networking resources:
**For instance connectivity**
  * **oci_vcn:** Metrics related to **VNICs**. See [VNIC Metrics](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Reference/vnicmetrics.htm#VNIC_Metrics).


**For cloud connectivity**
  * **oci_dynamic_routing_gateway:** Metrics related to **Dynamic Routing Gateway (DRG)**. See [DRG Metrics](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Reference/drgmetrics.htm#drgmetrics_topic-drg_metrics "You can monitor the health, capacity, and performance of upgraded dynamic routing gateways \(DRGs\) by using metrics, alarms, and notifications.").
  * **oci_fastconnect:** Metrics related to **FastConnect**. See [FastConnect Metrics](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Reference/fastconnectmetrics2.htm#FastConnect_Metrics).
  * **oci_internet_gateway:** Metrics related to **internet gateway**. See [Internet Gateway Metrics](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Reference/IGWmetrics.htm#IGWmetrics "You can monitor the health, capacity, and performance of your internet gateways by using metrics, alarms, and notifications.").
  * **oci_nat_gateway:** Metrics related to a **NAT gateway** See [NAT Gateway Metrics](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Reference/nat-gateway-metrics.htm#nat_gateway_metrics "You can monitor the health, capacity, and performance of your NAT gateways by using metrics, alarms, and notifications.").
  * **oci_service_gateway:** Metrics related to a **service gateway.** See [Service Gateway Metrics](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Reference/SGWmetrics.htm#Service_Gateway_Metrics "You can monitor the health, capacity, and performance of your service gateways by using metrics, alarms, and notifications."). 
  * **oci_vpn:** Metrics related to an **IPSec connection**. See [Site-to-Site VPN Metrics](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Reference/ipsecmetrics2.htm#VPN_Connect_Metrics).


**For other service metrics related to network traffic management**
  * **oci_lbaas:** Metrics related to a **load balancer**. See [Load Balancer Metrics](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Balance/Reference/loadbalancermetrics.htm).
  * **oci_nlb:** Metrics related to a **network load balancer**. See [Network Load Balancer Metrics](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/NetworkLoadBalancer/Metrics/metrics.htm).
  * **oci_network_firewall:** Metrics related to a **network firewall**. See [Monitoring Firewalls](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/network-firewall/metrics.htm).
  * For **oci_vcn** and **oci_nlb** metrics related to **VTAP** s, see [VTAP Metrics](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Reference/vtapmetrics.htm#vtapmetrics "You can monitor the health, capacity, and performance of your VTAPs by using metrics, alarms, and notifications.").


**Note** No service level metrics exist for local peering gateways (LPGs). See [Local VCN Peering using Local Peering Gateways](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/localVCNpeering.htm) for more information.
