  *     1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Networking**. Under **Customer connectivity** , select **Dynamic routing gateway**.
    2. Under **List Scope** , select a compartment that you have permission to work in.The page updates to display only the resources in that compartment. If you're not sure which compartment to use, contact an administrator. For more information, see [Access Control](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/accesscontrol.htm#Access_Control).
    3. Click the name of the DRG you're interested in.
    4. Under **Resources** , click **Remote Peering Connection attachments**.

    6. Click **Edit**.
    7. Provide the following information: 
       * **Display name** : Choose friendly name for the RPC. It doesn't have to be unique, and it can be changed later. Avoid entering confidential information.
       * **Choose a DRG route table** : Select a route table for the attachment to use. By default, the **Autogenerated DRG route table for RPC, VC, and IPSec attachments** is selected. 
       * **Enable dynamic export of routes from assigned DRG route table** : Check this option to allow BGP advertisement of routes from the chosen DRG route table. You would only leave this option unselected if you had a specific reason to do so.
