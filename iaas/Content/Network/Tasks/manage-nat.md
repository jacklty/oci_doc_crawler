# Managing a NAT Gateway
Describes how to create and manage NAT gateways that can be used to provide traffic flow to and from resources in the internet.
For the purposes of management access control, you must specify the compartment where you want the VCN to reside. Consult an administrator in your organization if you're not sure which compartment to use. For information about compartments and access control, see [Managing Compartments](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/compartments/managingcompartments.htm).
The following management actions are available for NAT gateways:
  * [Creating a NAT Gateway](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/nat-create.htm#nat-create "Create a NAT gateway in a virtual cloud network \(VCN\) in Networking.")
