# DRG Routing Management
Learn how to manage routing in a Dynamic Routing Gateway (DRG) in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
For more about DRG routing, read [Working with DRG Route Tables and Route Distributions](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/managingDRGs.htm#overview__rd_rt). See the [Learn routing in OCI Networking with examples (PDF)](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Resources/Assets/whitepapers/learn-routing-in-oci-networking-with-examples.pdf) technical brief to learn more about DRG routing.
The following operations are possible for DRG routing tables: 
  * [Creating a DRG Route Table](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/drg-rt-create.htm#drg-create_route_table "Create a Dynamic Routing Gateway \(DRG\) route table in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.")
  * [Getting DRG Route Table Information](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/drg-rt-get.htm#drg-get_route_table "Get information about the specified Dynamic Routing Gateway \(DRG\) route table.")
  * [Listing DRG Route Tables](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/drg-rt-list.htm#drg-list_route_table "List the Dynamic Routing Gateway \(DRG\) route tables in a DRG.")
  * [Updating a DRG Route Table](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/drg-rt-update.htm#drg-update_route_table "Update the settings for a Dynamic Routing Gateway \(DRG\) route table in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.")
  * [Deleting a DRG Route Table](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/drg-rt-delete.htm#drg-rt-delete "Delete a Dynamic Routing Gateway \(DRG\) route table in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.")


The following operations are possible for route rules in DRG routing tables: 
  * [Listing Route Rules in a DRG Route Table](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/drg-rtrule-list.htm#drg-rtrulelist "List the static and dynamic route rules in a Dynamic Routing Gateway \(DRG\) route table in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.")
  * [Adding Static Route Rules to a DRG Route Table](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/drg-rtrule-add.htm#drg-rtruleadd "Add one or more static route rules to a Dynamic Routing Gateway \(DRG\) route table in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.")
  * [Updating a Route Rule in a DRG Route Table](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/drg-rtrule-update.htm#drg-rtruleupdate "Update one or more route rules in the specified DRG route table.")
  * [Removing a Route Rule from a DRG Route Table](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/drg-rtrule-remove.htm#drg-rtruleremove "Delete one or more route rules from the specified DRG route table.")


The following operations are possible for route distributions in DRG routing tables: 
  * [Creating a Route Distribution](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/drg-rd-create.htm#drg-rd-create "Create an import or export route distribution for a Dynamic Routing Gateway \(DRG\) in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.")
  * [Getting Route Distribution Details](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/drg-rd-get.htm#drg-rd-get "Get information for a specific route distribution.")
  * [Listing Route Distributions](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/drg-rd-list.htm#drg-rd-list "Get a list of route distributions in the specified DRG.")
  * [Updating a Route Distribution](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/drg-rd-update.htm#drg-rd-update "Update a route distribution for a Dynamic Routing Gateway \(DRG\) in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.")
  * [Removing an Export Route Distribution from a DRG Route Table](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/drg-rd-remove-export-rd.htm#drg-rd-remove_export_rd "Remove an export route distribution from a DRG route table.")
  * [Removing an Import Route Distribution from a DRG Route Table](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/drg-remove-import-route-distribution.htm#drg-remove_import_route_distribution "Remove the import route distribution from a Dynamic Routing Gateway \(DRG\) route table in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure so that no routes are imported into it.")
  * [Deleting a Route Distribution](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/drg-rd-delete.htm#drg-rd-delete "Delete a specified route distribution.")


The following operations are possible for route distribution statements in DRG routing tables: 
  * [Listing Route Distribution Statements](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/drg-rds-list.htm#drg-rds-list "List the statements for an import or export route distribution for a dynamic routing gateway \(DRG\) in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.")
  * [Adding a Route Distribution Statement](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/drg-rds-add.htm#drg-rds-add "Add a statement to an import or export route distribution for a dynamic routing gateway \(DRG\) in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.")
  * [Updating a Route Distribution Statement](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/drg-rds-update.htm#drg-rds-update "Update one or more route distribution statements in the specified route distribution.")
  * [Delete a Route Distribution Statement](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/drg-rds-remove.htm#drg-rds-remove "Remove or delete one or more route distribution statements from a route distribution for a Dynamic Routing Gateway \(DRG\) in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.")
