# Removing a Network Security Group (NSG) from a Resolver Endpoint
You can remove network security groups (NSGs) from your resolver endpoint. The NSG no longer acts as a virtual firewall for the endpoint.
See [Private DNS resolvers](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/dns-topic-Private-resolver.htm#Private_resolver "A private DNS resolver answers DNS queries for a VCN per a configuration you create.") and [Resolver Endpoints](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/dns-topic-resolver_endpoints.htm#dns_topic_resolver_endpoints "Resolver endpoints are attached to a VCN or a subnet.") for more information about resolvers and endpoints in your VCN.
## Using the Console ðŸ”— 
  1. From the **Private Resolver Details** screen, click the **Action** button to the right of the endpoint you want to delete, and then click **Delete**. 
  2. Confirm the deletion by clicking **Delete**
