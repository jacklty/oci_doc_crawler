# VCN and Subnet Management
Describes how to create and manage VCNs that can be used to provide traffic flow to and from resources such as compute instances.
For the purposes of management access control, you must specify the compartment where you want the VCN to reside. Consult an administrator in your organization if you're not sure which compartment to use. For information about compartments and access control, see [Managing Compartments](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/compartments/managingcompartments.htm).
The following management actions are available for VCNs and subnets:
  * [Creating a VCN](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/create_vcn.htm#top "Create a VCN that instances, load balancers, and other resources can use to connect to each other and the internet. After you create a VCN, you must then manually create subnets, gateways, routing rules, and security settings before the VCN can connect to the internet or your on-premises network.")
  * [Listing VCNs](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/list-vcn.htm#top "List the VCNs available in a given compartment.")
  * [Getting a VCN's Details](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/get_vcn_details.htm#top "View the settings for a particular Virtual Cloud Network \(VCN\).")
  * [Updating a VCN](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/update-vcn.htm#top "You can update the display name and the tags for a VCN.")
  * [Adding IP Address Ranges to a VCN](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/add_cidr_to_vcn.htm#top "You can add an IPv4 CIDR block or IPv6 prefix to a Virtual Cloud Network \(VCN\), with some limitations.")
  * [Changing a VCN's IPv4 CIDR blocks](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/edit_vcn_cidr.htm#top "You can change the IPv4 CIDR block range assigned to a Virtual Cloud Network \(VCN\), with some restrictions.")
  * [Removing an IPv4 CIDR Block or IPv6 Prefix from a VCN](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/remove_cidr_block_vcn.htm#top "You can remove an IPv4 CIDR block or IPv6 prefix from a Virtual Cloud Network \(VCN\), with some restrictions.")
  * [Tagging a VCN](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/manage_tags_vcn.htm#top "Add metadata to virtual cloud networks \(VCNs\) in the form of tags. Tags enable you to define keys and values and associate them with resources.")
  * [Moving a VCN Between Compartments](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/move_vcn_compartment.htm#top "You can move a VCN from one compartment to another.")
  * [Deleting a VCN](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/delete_vcn.htm#top "Delete a Virtual Cloud Network \(VCN\) from OCI.")
  * [Creating a Subnet](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/create_subnet.htm#top "Create a subnet in a VCN. A subnet is a logical subdivision of a Virtual Cloud Network \(VCN\). Each subnet consists of a contiguous range of IP addresses that don't overlap with other subnets in the VCN.")
  * [Listing Subnets](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/list-subnets.htm#top "List the subnets available in a given VCN.")
  * [Getting a Subnet's Details](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/get-subnet.htm#top "Get configuration details for a specific subnet in a virtual cloud network \(VCN\).")
  * [Editing a Subnet](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/edit_subnet.htm#top "Edit the settings for a subnet in a Virtual Cloud Network \(VCN\).")
  * [Adding an IPv6 Prefix to a Subnet](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/add-subnet-prefix.htm#top "Add an IPv6 prefix to a subnet in a Virtual Cloud Network \(VCN\).")
  * [Removing an IPv6 Prefix from a Subnet](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/remove-subnet-prefix.htm#top "Remove an IPv6 prefix from a subnet in a Virtual Cloud Network \(VCN\).")
  * [Moving a Subnet to a Different Compartment](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/move_subnet_compartment.htm#top "Move a subnet in a Virtual Cloud Network \(VCN\) to a different compartment.")
  * [Tagging a Subnet](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/manage_tags_subnet.htm#top "Add tags to a subnet.")
  * [Deleting a Subnet](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/delete_subnet.htm#top "Delete a subnet from a Virtual Cloud Network \(VCN\).")
