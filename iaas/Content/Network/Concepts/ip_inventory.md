# IP Address Insights
Use IP Address Insights to get a holistic view of the IP addresses used across a tenancy, potentially spanning multiple compartments.
IP Address Insights provides you with a hierarchical visbility into VCNs, respective subnets, and network resources, enabling you to centrally monitor and manage IP administration for cloud assets with ease. It also provides the data on IP utilization to identify potential issues and resolve them. Using IP Address Insights, you can:
  * View IP addresses used across a tenancy
  * View IP utilization of network resources in a tenancy
  * Review IP conflicts
  * Manage alarms when IP utilization crosses a threshold


## Required IAM Policies ðŸ”— 
To use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, you must be granted security access in a **policy** by an administrator. This access is required whether you're using the Console or the REST API with an SDK, CLI, or other tool. If you get a message that you donâ€™t have permission or are unauthorized, verify with your administrator what type of access you have and which **compartment** to work in.
For administrators, see [IAM Policies for Networking](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/accesscontrol.htm#Policies).
Create this policy to allow a group to access IP Address Management (IPAM) in the tenancy or a specific compartment.
Copy
```
Allow group <group-name> to read ipam in tenancy
```

Copy
```
Allow group <group-name> to read ipam in compartment <compartment-name>
```
