The following diagnostic and troubleshooting services are considered part of the Network Command Center: 
  * [Inter-Region Latency](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/inter_region_latency.htm#inter_region_latency "View the Inter-Region Latency dashboard in the Console. The dashboard provides the average network round-trip latency \(round-trip time or RTT\) for all pairs of regions in an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure realm.

  * [Network Path Analyzer](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/path_analyzer.htm#path_analyzer "Learn about the Network Path Analyzer tool.")
  * [Network Visualizer](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/network_visualizer.htm#network-visualizer "Learn about the Network Visualizer tool in Network Command Center.")
  * [Virtual Test Access Points (VTAPs)](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/vtap.htm#vtap "A Virtual Test Access Point \(VTAP\) provides a way to mirror traffic from a selected source to a selected target to help in troubleshooting, security analysis, and data monitoring.")
  * [Flow Logs](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/vcn-flow-logs.htm#vcn_flow_logs "Use VCN flow logs to capture network traffic information to support monitoring and security needs.")
