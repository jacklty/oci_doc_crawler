# Public IP Pools
A public IP pool is simply a set of IPv4 CIDR blocks allocated to a tenancy. These CIDR blocks can be all or part of a BYOIP CIDR block. Public IP CIDR blocks assigned to a pool are only available for your tenancy. Public IP pools are available as a source for IP allocation when launching a NAT gateway, load balancer, or compute instance. You can add more IP CIDR blocks to a public IP pool at any time. You can also: 
  * **Create a Reserved IP:** You can reserve individual IPs from your public IP pools. These reserved IP addresses can be attached to your resources.
  * **Direct launch from pool:** You can launch resources with an IP directly allocated from a public IP pool without previously creating a reserved IP for that resource.
  * **Delete CIDR blocks and pools:** You can delete the entire public IP pool or certain IP CIDR blocks within the pool, provided none of the IP addresses are currently attached or reserved.


**Note** IPv6 addresses do not use the IP Pools functionality described here. Instead, you can directly assign IPv6 prefixes to VCNs and subnets.
## Requirements and Preparation ðŸ”— 
  * To use public IP pools with BYOIP addresses, you need to import your addresses.
  * To reserve Oracle-supplied public IP addresses, select "Oracle" as the public IP pool when creating the reserved public IP address.


## Limits and quotas ðŸ”— 
  * You can create one or up to 10 public IP pools in a compartment.
  * A public IP pool can have zero or more IP CIDR ranges assigned to it, with a minimum size of /28 to a maximum size of /24.


See [IP Management Limits](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/servicelimits.htm#byoip_limits) for general information and [requesting a service limit increase](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/servicelimits.htm#Requesti) when necessary.
## Required IAM Policy
To use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, an administrator must be a member of a group granted security access in a **policy** by a tenancy administrator. This access is required whether you're using the Console or the REST API with an SDK, CLI, or other tool. If you get a message that you don't have permission or are unauthorized, verify with the tenancy administrator what type of access you have and which **compartment** your access works in.
For administrators: see [IAM Policies for Networking](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/accesscontrol.htm#Policies). 
## Limits on IAM Resources ðŸ”— 
For a list of applicable limits and [instructions for requesting a limit increase](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/servicelimits.htm#Requesti), see [Service Limits](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/servicelimits.htm). To set compartment-specific limits on a resource or resource family, administrators can use [compartment quotas](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Quotas/Concepts/resourcequotas.htm).
## Managing IP pools using the console ðŸ”— 
[To view your public IP pools](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/ip_pools.htm)
  1. Confirm you're viewing the region and compartment you're interested in. 
  2. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Networking**. Under **IP management** , select **Public IP pools**.
