#  FastConnect: Colocation with Oracle
This topic is for customers who are colocated with Oracle in a FastConnect location. 
For a summary of the different ways to connect, see [How and Where to Connect](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectoverview.htm#How). 
If you instead have a relationship with one of the [FastConnect Partners](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/networking/fastconnect/partners/), see [FastConnect: With an Oracle Partner](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectprovider.htm#FastConnect_With_an_Oracle_Partner "This topic is for customers who want to use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure FastConnect by connecting to an Oracle Partner."). Or if you have a relationship with a third-party provider, see [FastConnect: With a Third-Party Provider](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectthirdpartyprovider.htm#FastConnect_With_a_ThirdParty_Provider "This topic is for customers who want to use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure FastConnect by connecting to a third-party network provider of their choice, and not an Oracle Partner.").
For general information about FastConnect, see [FastConnect](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnect.htm#FC_landing "Oracle Cloud Infrastructure FastConnect provides an easy way to create a dedicated, private connection between your data center and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.").
**Note** It is possible to connect two VCNs in different regions using FastConnect colocation, with inter-region traffic using that link rather than the Oracle backbone. A Layer 3 device is required to implement this, even for a layer 2 connection. Details of this use case are not available, but are similar to [Connecting Oracle Cloud Infrastructure to Amazon VPC with Megaport Cloud Router](https://blogs.oracle.com/cloud-infrastructure/connecting-oracle-cloud-infrastructure-to-amazon-vpc-with-megaport-cloud-router) or [Connecting Oracle Cloud Infrastructure to Google Cloud Platform with Equinix Network Edge Cloud Router](https://blogs.oracle.com/cloud-infrastructure/connecting-oracle-cloud-infrastructure-to-google-cloud-platform-with-equinix-network-edge-cloud-router). 
## Getting Started with FastConnect ðŸ”— 
**Note** In general, this topic assumes that your router supports link aggregation (LAG) and you will set up a cross-connect group (a LAG) with at least one cross-connect in it. The following procedures reflect that. However, if your router doesn't support link aggregation, you can instead set up a single non-LAG cross-connect (with no cross-connect group). The procedures in this topic are still generally applicable. Instead you work only with a single cross-connect and not one or more in a cross-connect group. 
### Learn and Plan
If you haven't yet, walk through the planning in [Before Getting Started: Learn and Plan](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectrequirements.htm#Before). Also see [FastConnect Redundancy Best Practices](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectresiliency.htm#FastConnect_Redundancy_Best_Practices "This topic covers best practices for redundancy when implementing FastConnect.") and [Hardware and Routing Requirements](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectrequirements.htm#requirements).
You may also need to review information on how [to use FastConnect if you do not own a Public ASN or Public IP Address](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectoverview.htm#public_asn_ip).
The following diagram shows the overall process of setting up FastConnect with colocation. The tasks described below are represented in the diagram.
[![This chart shows the steps for getting started with FastConnect](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Images/network_fc_colo_flow.svg)](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Images/network_fc_colo_flow.svg)
[Task 1: Set up a DRG (private peering only)](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectcolocate.htm)
**Summary:** If you plan to use a private virtual circuit (private peering), you need a DRG. If you haven't already, use the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console to set up a DRG, attach it to the VCN, and update routing in the VCN to include a route rule to send traffic to the DRG. Remember to update the route table. Without the route rule, no traffic can flow. 
**Instructions:**
  * [Creating a DRG](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/drg-create.htm#drg-create "Create a Dynamic Routing Gateway \(DRG\) in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.")
  * [Attaching a VCN to a DRG](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/attach-vcn-drg.htm#attach-vcn-drg "Attach a Virtual Cloud Network \(VCN\) to a Dynamic Routing Gateway \(DRG\).")
  * [Updating a VCN Route Table's Rules](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/update-rules-routetable.htm#update-rules-routetable "Add, edit, or delete rules for a Virtual Cloud Network \(VCN\) route table.")


[Task 2: Set up your cross-connect group and cross-connect](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectcolocate.htm)
**Summary:** Create a connection in the Console, which consists of a cross-connect group (for link aggregation, or LAG) that contains at least one cross-connect. If you need more cross-connects in the group, you can [add them later](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectcolocate.htm#add_cc_to_ccg). You can have a maximum of eight cross-connects in a group.
You have the option to set up a single non-LAG cross-connect (with no cross-connect group) if your router does not support link aggregation (LAG).
When you create a cross connect using colocation, OCI metering starts when a cross connect or cross connect group is activated, or 30 days after the LOA for cross connect or cross connect group was generated, which ever is the earliest.
**Instructions:**
  1. In the Console, confirm you're viewing the **compartment** that you want to work in. If you're not sure which one, use the compartment that contains the DRG that you'll connect to (for a private virtual circuit). This choice of compartment, in conjunction with a corresponding [IAM policy](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/commonpolicies.htm), controls who has access to the cross-connect group and each cross-connect you're about to create. 
  2. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Networking**. Under **Customer connectivity** , select **FastConnect**.
The resulting **FastConnect** page is where you'll create a new connection and later return to when you need to manage the connection and its components.
  3. Click **Create FastConnect**.
  4. Select **FastConnect Direct**.
  5. Select one of the following options: 
     * **Location redundancy:** This option creates a connection with a two redundant virtual circuits in different FastConnect locations used by the same OCI region. 
     * **Device redundancy (Recommended):** This option creates a connection with a two redundant virtual circuits in the same FastConnect location. 
     * **Single FastConnect:** This option creates a connection with a single virtual circuit. You can create redundancy later if you decide to.
See [FastConnect Redundancy Best Practices](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectresiliency.htm#FastConnect_Redundancy_Best_Practices "This topic covers best practices for redundancy when implementing FastConnect.") for more about redundancy.
  6. Click **Next**. 
  7. Enter the following items:
**Note**
If you chose **Location redundancy** or **Device redundancy (Recommended)** you see these options for both **Connection 1** and **Connection 2**. 
     * **Name:** A descriptive name for this connection. You can't change the name later. Avoid entering confidential information. If you're creating a cross-connect group, the cross-connect group uses this name. Each cross-connect in this group also uses it, but with a hyphen and number appended (for example, MyName-1, MyName-2, and so on).
     * **Compartment:** Leave as is (the compartment you're currently working in). 
     * **Cross-Connect Type:**
       * If the on-premises edge router supports link aggregation (LAG), select **Cross-Connect Group**. You create a cross-connect group (a LAG) with at least one cross-connect. 
       * If the on-premises edge router doesn't support LAG, select **Single Cross-Connect**. You create a single cross-connect with no cross-connect group.
     * **Reference Name:** The ID for the physical LAG for the cross-connect group. This makes future connection troubleshooting easier. You might need to get this value from the third-party provider. If you don't have it, you can add it later. If you're creating a single cross-connect, enter the ID for the physical fiber cable for the cross-connect. 
     * **Number of cross-connects:** Available only if you're creating a cross-connect group. This is the number of individual cross-connects to create in the cross-connect group. In the Console, you can create three. If you need more, you can [add more cross-connects later](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectcolocate.htm#add_cc_to_ccg) (total eight in a cross-connect group).
     * **Port speed:** 1 Gbps, 10 Gbps, 100 Gbps, or 400 Gbps.
     * **Encryption:** If the connection uses [MACsec encryption](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectsecurity.htm#macsec), you must select a **Port Speed** of 10 Gbps or greater. You also need to provision the CAK and CKN as individual secrets in a [Vault](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/KeyManagement/Concepts/keyoverview.htm). Click the **Enable MACsec Encryption** box and enter the following information: 
       * **Encryption Algorithm:** The encryption cipher suite to use for the MACsec connection.
       * **Connectivity Association Key (CAK):** Choose a Vault and a secret representing the CAK. 
       * **Connectivity Association Key Name (CKN):** Choose a Vault and a secret representing the CKN. 
You can also click **Show advanced options** to select what happens if the MACsec session fails. The choices are: 
       * **Fail Close** : This is the default and is recommended. If the MACsec session fails and traffic encryption is no longer available, no traffic is sent over the virtual circuit until the MACsec connection can be re-established. This option prioritizes security over reachability.
       * **Fail Open** : If the MACsec session fails and traffic encryption is no longer available, unencrypted traffic is sent over the virtual circuit until the MACsec connection can be re-established. This option prioritizes reachability over security. This option isn't recommended if MACsec is required by your organization's security standards.
     * **Physical location:** The FastConnect location for this connection. If you chose **Device redundancy (Recommended)** the physical location settings for **Connection 1** and **Connection 2** must match, and you can only select them from **Connection 1**. If you chose **Location redundancy** , the physical location settings for **Connection 1** and **Connection 2** must be different, and their selections are independent.
     * **Specify Router Proximity** : Optionally specify whether you want the new connection to be on the same or different router in that FastConnect location than one of the other connections. 
  8. Click **Create**. 
The new connection is created. 
  9. Click **Close** to see a list of connections on the FastConnect page. 
  10. Click the name of the new connection to see its details. 
  11. **Print the LOA for each cross-connect:** Each cross-connect you just created has a [Letter of Authorization (LOA)](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectoverview.htm#concepts__LoA). View each cross-connect's details, and then view and print the cross-connect's LOA. In the next task, you submit it with your cabling request at the FastConnect location. The cross-connect's status is PENDING CUSTOMER until you complete the next few tasks.
**Note** When you don't provide the Oracle LOA with your order, and instead give your own independent authorization just giving a building address, the details (such as the required panel and port) required for a cross connect aren't included in the price quote and the work order. You might think that placing the order first saves time, but in practice it will most often have to be redone from the beginning, taking far more time than expected. 
The see the LOA, click **View** next to **Letter of Authorization** in the detail screen for the connection you just created.


[Task 3: Submit LOA and request cabling in the FastConnect location](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectcolocate.htm)
At the FastConnect location, submit each LOA from the preceding task and request cabling for each cross-connect. Each LOA is valid for a limited time. The details are printed on the LOA.
[Task 4: Check light levels](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectcolocate.htm)
For each cross-connect's physical fiber cable, confirm from your side that the light levels are good (> -15 dBm). Don't proceed until they are.
In the Console, you can see the light levels that Oracle detects by viewing the details of the cross-connect (look for **Light Level Indicator** ![activated](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Images/activated.png) Good).
[Task 5: Activate each cross-connect](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectcolocate.htm)
**Summary:** When your physical fiber cables in the FastConnect location are set up and ready to use, return to the Oracle Console and activate each cross-connect that you set up earlier. The process of activating a cross-connect informs Oracle that the corresponding physical fiber cable is ready. Oracle will then complete the router configuration for each cross-connect.**Instructions:**
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Networking**. Under **Customer connectivity** , select **FastConnect**.
  2. Select the compartment where the connection resides, and then click the connection to view its details.
  3. Click through to view the cross-connect's details, and then click **Activate**.
  4. Confirm when prompted.
  5. While still viewing the cross-connect's details, click **Edit** and enter the ID for the physical fiber cable for this cross-connect. Adding this value can help with any connection troubleshooting in the future. If you don't have the value available now, you can add it later. 

If you have other cross-connects that are ready to use, wait for the first to be provisioned, and then activate the next one. Only one cross-connect in a group can be activated and then provisioned at a time. After you complete this task, each cross-connect's status changes from PENDING CUSTOMER to PROVISIONING and then to PROVISIONED (typically within three minutes). 
[Task 6: Confirm that your interfaces are up](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectcolocate.htm)
For each cross-connect's physical fiber cable, confirm your side of the interfaces are up. Don't proceed until they are.
In the Console, you can see the status of Oracle's side of the interfaces (up or down) by viewing the details of the cross-connect (see the preceding screenshot in task 5).
**Note** The Interface State will either be "Down" or "Up" until the cross-connect is activated. Even though light levels are good, the interface may still appear to be down prior to activation.
[Task 7: Set up your virtual circuit](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectcolocate.htm)
**Summary:** Create one or more virtual circuits for a connection in the Oracle Console. The cross-connect group (or a single non-LAG cross-connect) must first be in the PROVISIONED state. 
**Important** To use a _single_ FastConnect to connect an on-premises existing network to _multiple_ DRGs and VCNs, you must set up a different private virtual circuit for each VCN. Each virtual circuit must have a different VLAN and a different set of BGP IP addresses. For more information, see [FastConnect with Multiple DRGs and VCNs](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectmultipledrgs.htm#FastConnect_with_Multiple_DRGs_and_VCNs).
**Instructions:**
  1. In the Console, return to the connection you created earlier. Under **Resources** , click **Virtual Circuits**.
  2. Click **Create Virtual Circuit**.
  3. Enter the following for the new virtual circuit:
     * **Name:** A descriptive name for the virtual circuit. The value doesn't need to be unique across all virtual circuits, and you can change it later. Avoid entering confidential information.
     * **Compartment:** Select the compartment where you want to create the virtual circuit. If you're not sure, use the current compartment. This choice of compartment, along with a corresponding [IAM policy](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/commonpolicies.htm), controls who has access to the virtual circuit. 
  4. Select the virtual circuit type (private or public). A private virtual circuit is for private peering (where an on-premises network receives routes for a VCN's private IP addresses). A public virtual circuit is for public peering (where an on-premises network receives routes for the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure public IP addresses). Also see [Uses for FastConnect](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectoverview.htm#uses).
     * For a private virtual circuit, enter the following:
       * Select either **All traffic** or **IPSec over FastConnect traffic only**. The virtual circuit can be used for [IPSec over FastConnect](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectsecurity.htm#ipsec) with either choice, but you can select an option to only have encrypted traffic on the virtual circuit. For the prerequisites to use **IPSec over FastConnect traffic only** option, see [TransportOnly Mode: Only Allowing Encrypted Traffic on a Virtual Circuit](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectsecurity.htm#fastconnectsecurity_topic-transport).
       * **Dynamic Routing Gateway:** Select the DRG to route the FastConnect traffic to.
       * **Provisioned Bandwidth:** Select the value for the bandwidth assigned to the virtual circuit. If the bandwidth needs to increase later, you can update the virtual circuit to use a different value (see [To edit a virtual circuit](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectcolocate.htm#edit_vc)).
       * **VLAN:** The number of the VLAN to use for this virtual circuit. It must be a VLAN not already assigned to another virtual circuit.
       * **Customer BGP IP Address:** The BGP peering IP address for the on-premises edge (a CPE), with a subnet mask from /28 to /31.
       * **Oracle BGP IP Address:** The BGP peering IP address you want to use for the Oracle edge (the DRG), with a subnet mask from /28 to /31.
       * **Enable IPv6 Address Assignment:** IPv6 addressing is supported for all commercial and government regions. For more information, see [FastConnect and IPv6](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/ipv6.htm#fastconnect).
       * **Customer BGP ASN:** The public or private ASN for an on-premises network.
       * **Use a BGP MD5 Authentication Key (optional):** Select this checkbox and provide a key if your system requires MD5 authentication. Oracle supports up to 128-bit MD5 authentication.
       * **Enable Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (optional):** Select this checkbox to enable[ Bidirectional Forwarding Detection](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectoverview.htm#concepts). 
**Note** When you use Bidirectional Forwarding Detection, the paired device must be configured to use a 300 ms minimum interval and a multiplier of 3.
     * For a public virtual circuit, enter the following:
       * **Provisioned Bandwidth:** Select the value for the bandwidth assigned to the virtual circuit. If the bandwidth needs to increase later, you can update the virtual circuit to use a different value (see [To edit a virtual circuit](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectcolocate.htm#edit_vc)).
       * **Public IP Prefixes:** The public IP prefixes that you want Oracle to receive over the connection. All prefix sizes are allowed. You can enter a comma-separated list of prefixes, or one per line.
       * **Route Filtering:** Select a [Route Filtering](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/routingonprem2.htm#route_filtering) option. This selects the routes included in BGP advertisements to an on-premises network.
       * **VLAN:** The number of the VLAN to use for this virtual circuit. It must be a VLAN not already assigned to another virtual circuit.
       * **Customer BGP ASN:** The public ASN for an on-premises network. Note that Oracle specifies the BGP IP addresses for a public virtual circuit.
       * **Use a BGP MD5 Authentication Key (optional):** Select this checkbox and provide a key if your system requires MD5 authentication. Oracle supports up to 128-bit MD5 authentication.
       * **Enable Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (optional):** Select this checkbox to enable [Bidirectional Forwarding Detection](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectoverview.htm#concepts). 
  5. (Optional) In the **Redundant cross-connect** panel, you can select **Attach an additional cross-connect** which configures the virtual circuit to span another cross-connect with an additional BGP session. You then select:
     * **Compartment:** Select the compartment where you want to create the redundant virtual circuit. If you're not sure, use the current compartment. This choice of compartment, along with a corresponding [IAM policy](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/commonpolicies.htm), controls who has access to the virtual circuit. 
     * **Cross-connect:** Select an existing cross-connect from the pull-down list.
     * **Customer BGP ASN:** The public ASN for an on-premises network. Note that Oracle specifies the BGP IP addresses for a public virtual circuit.
     * **Enable IPv6 Address Assignment:** IPv6 addressing is supported for all commercial and government regions. For more information, see [FastConnect and IPv6](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/ipv6.htm#fastconnect).
     * **Use a BGP MD5 Authentication Key (optional):** Select this checkbox and provide a key if your system requires MD5 authentication. Oracle supports up to 128-bit MD5 authentication.
  6. Click **Create**. 
The virtual circuit is created. 
The virtual circuit's status is PROVISIONING briefly while Oracle's system provisions the virtual circuit. The status then switches to DOWN if the BGP session between the on-premises edge device and Oracle's edge isn't yet correctly configured, if the VLAN isn't configured correctly, or if there any other problems. Otherwise the status switches to UP. 


[Task 8: Configure your edge](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectcolocate.htm)
Configure each of your edge routers to use the BGP information and VLAN for the virtual circuit. Oracle's BGP ASN for the commercial cloud is 31898, except the Serbia Central (Jovanovac) region which is 14544. For the Government Cloud, see [Oracle's BGP ASN](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/govinfo.htm#bgp_asn). If you need fast BGP convergence, you can use any value in these supported ranges: 6 to 60 seconds for keep-alive, and 18 to 180 seconds for hold-time. BGP timers are negotiated between the two BGP peers to the lower value used by one of the two sides. 
**Important** For a public virtual circuit: An existing network can receive advertisements for Oracle's public IP addresses through several paths (for example: FastConnect and the internet service provider). Ensure that FastConnect has higher preference than the ISP. You must configure the edge appropriately so that traffic uses the preferred path to receive the benefits of FastConnect. This is important if you decide to _also_ set up the existing network with [private access to Oracle services](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/transitroutingoracleservices.htm#Transit_Routing_Private_Access_to_Oracle_Services). For important information about path preferences, see [Routing Details for Connections to the On-premises Network](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/routingonprem2.htm#Routing_Details_for_Connections_to_Your_OnPremises_Network).
If you have a cross-connect group (a LAG) with one or more cross-connects in it, here are details to know about LACP: 
  * LACP is required on the network interface that is directly plugged in to Oracle's router. 
  * LACP is required even if you have only a single cross-connect in the cross-connect group.
  * If the third-party provider is performing any media conversion, LACP must be configured on the provider's device instead of your device.

Also configure the router for redundancy according to the network design you decided on earlier. After you successfully configure BGP and the VLAN, the virtual circuit's status will switch to UP. 
[Task 9: Ping the Oracle BGP IP address](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectcolocate.htm)
Ping the Oracle BGP IP address assigned to the virtual circuit. Check the error counters and look for any dropped packets. Don't proceed until you can successfully ping this IP address without errors.
If you've set up a cross-connect group: if the ping is not successful, and you're NOT learning MAC addresses, verify that you configured LACP as mentioned in Task 8. 
[Task 10: Confirm that the BGP session is established](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectcolocate.htm)
For each virtual circuit you set up, confirm the BGP session is in an established state on your side of the connection. 
[Task 11: Test the connection](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectcolocate.htm)
**For a private virtual circuit:** You should be able to launch an instance in your VCN and access it (for example, with SSH) from a host in your existing private network. See [Creating an Instance](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/launchinginstance.htm). If you can, your FastConnect private virtual circuit is ready to use.
**For a public virtual circuit:**
  1. Ensure that Oracle has successfully verified _at least one_ of the public prefixes you submitted. You can see the status of each prefix by viewing the virtual circuit's details in the Console. When one of the prefixes has been validated, Oracle starts advertising the regional Oracle Cloud Infrastructure public addresses over the connection. 
  2. Create an instance with a public IP address.
  3. Ping the public IP address from a host in an existing private network. If you see the packet on the FastConnect interface on the virtual circuit, the FastConnect public virtual circuit is ready to use. However, remember that _only the public prefixes that Oracle has successfully verified so far_ are advertised on the connection.


## Managing Your Connection ðŸ”— 
[To get the status of your connection](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectcolocate.htm)
Look at the icon for the particular part of the connection that you're interested in (cross-connect group, cross-connect, or virtual circuit).
Here are reasons for particular status values:
[Cross-Connect: PENDING CUSTOMER](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectcolocate.htm)
  * You need to submit the LOA and request cabling at the FastConnect location. See [Task 3: Submit LOA and request cabling in the FastConnect location](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectcolocate.htm#task_forward_loa).
  * Or, you need to activate a cross-connect after confirming it's ready to use. See [Task 5: Activate each cross-connect](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectcolocate.htm#task_activate_cc), but make sure you've performed tasks 5 and 6 first.


[Virtual circuit: DOWN](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectcolocate.htm)
In general this means you've created a virtual circuit, but configuration is incomplete or incorrect:
  * You need to configure your edge. See [Task 8: Configure your edge](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectcolocate.htm#configure_edge).
  * Or, you've configured BGP or the VLAN incorrectly on your edge (make sure to configure the router to use the BGP and VLAN values assigned to the virtual circuit).


The following table summarizes the different states of each component involved in the connection at different points during setup:

[Task 8: Configure your edge](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectcolocate.htm#configure_edge) | PROVISIONED | PROVISIONED |  DOWN > UP  
[To add a new cross-connect to an existing cross-connect group](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectcolocate.htm)
When you first create a cross-connect group in the Console, you're allowed to create three cross-connects in the group. You can later add more to increase the bandwidth and resiliency of the group. The total allowed number is eight.
  1. Create the new cross-connect in the existing cross-connect group:
    1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Networking**. Under **Customer connectivity** , select **FastConnect**.
    2. Select the compartment where the connection resides, and then click the connection to view its details. 
    3. Click **Add Cross-Connect**.
    4. Enter the following items:
       * **Name:** A descriptive name that helps you keep track of this cross-connect. The value does not need to be unique across your cross-connects. You can't change the name later. Avoid entering confidential information.
       * **Reference Name:** Your ID for the physical fiber cable for the cross-connect. This makes future connection troubleshooting easier. If you don't have it, you can add it later.
    5. Click **Add**.
The cross-connect is created. The status of the cross-connect is PENDING CUSTOMER to indicate that you have more work to do.
    6. Print the new cross-connect's LOA. You submit it with your cabling order in the next step.
  2. Perform tasks 4-7 in [Getting Started with FastConnect](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectcolocate.htm#getting_started). In summary, you need to have the cabling set up for the new cross-connect, validate the light levels and interfaces are good, and then activate the cross-connect.


[To deactivate and activate a virtual circuit](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectcolocate.htm)
**Important** This action is provided so you can test failover of redundant virtual circuits as described in [Maintaining Virtual Circuits](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/vc-maintenance.htm#vc-maintenance "Learn about planned maintenance of FastConnect virtual circuits."). The BGP session between on-premises and OCI networks is temporarily shut down (this isn't a "graceful shutdown") and resumes quickly after failover is validated.
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Networking**. Under **Customer connectivity** , select **FastConnect**.
  2. Select the compartment where the connection resides, and then select the virtual circuit to view its details. 
  3. Select **Deactivate**.
  4. Confirm that traffic is flowing as expected on the redundant virtual circuit.
  5. Select **Activate**.


[To edit a virtual circuit](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectcolocate.htm)
You can change these items for a virtual circuit:
  * The name
  * Which DRG it uses (for a private virtual circuit)
  * The bandwidth
  * The BGP session information, including IPv6 addressing
  * The BGP MD5 authentication key
  * Enable or disable Bidirectional Forwarding Detection
  * The public IP prefixes (for a public virtual circuit)
  * Set the virtual circuit to ACTIVE or INACTIVE


**Important**
Notes About Editing a Virtual Circuit
If a virtual circuit is working and in the PROVISIONED state before you edit it, be aware that changing any of the properties besides the name, bandwidth, and public prefixes (for a public virtual circuit) causes the virtual circuit's state to switch to PROVISIONING and **might cause the related BGP session to go down.** After Oracle reprovisions the virtual circuit, its state returns to PROVISIONED. Confirm that the associated BGP session is back up.
If you change the public IP prefixes for a public virtual circuit, the BGP status is unaffected. Oracle begins advertising a new IP prefix over the connection only after verifying ownership of it. The virtual circuit's state changes to PROVISIONING while Oracle implements any prefix changes.
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Networking**. Under **Customer connectivity** , select **FastConnect**.
  2. Select the compartment where the connection resides, and then click the connection to view its details. 
  3. Click **Virtual Circuits** , and then click the virtual circuit to view its details. 
  4. Click **Edit** and make your changes. Avoid entering confidential information.
  5. Click **Save Changes**.
  6. (Optional) To temporarily deactivate a virtual circuit, click **Deactivate**. To re-activate the circuit, click **Activate**. Deactivating the virtual circuit suspends the BGP session and traffic flow without otherwise changing the settings for the virtual circuit.

[To manage public IP prefixes for a public virtual circuit](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectcolocate.htm)
For general information about the prefixes, see [Basic Network Diagrams](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectoverview.htm#diagrams). 
You can specify your public IP prefixes when you create the virtual circuit. See [Task 7: Set up your virtual circuit](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectcolocate.htm#task_set_up_vc).
You can add or remove public IP prefixes later after creating the virtual circuit. See [To edit a virtual circuit](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectcolocate.htm#edit_vc). If you add a new prefix, Oracle first verifies your company's ownership before advertising it across the connection. If you remove a prefix, Oracle stops advertising the prefix within a few minutes of your editing the virtual circuit.
You can view the state of Oracle's verification of a given public prefix by viewing the virtual circuit's details in the Console. Here are the possible values:
  * **In progress:** Oracle is in the process of verifying your organization's ownership of the prefix. 
  * **Failed:** Oracle could not verify your organization's ownership. Oracle will not advertise the prefix over the virtual circuit.
  * **Completed:** Oracle successfully verified your organization's ownership. Oracle is advertising the prefix over the virtual circuit.


[To move a connection to a different compartment](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectcolocate.htm)
You can move a connection from one compartment to another. After you move the connection to the new compartment, inherent policies apply immediately and affect access to the connection through the Console. Moving the connection to a different compartment does not affect the connection between your data center and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. For more information, see [To move a resource to a different compartment](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcompartments.htm#To_move_a_resource_to_a_different_compartment).
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Networking**. Under **Customer connectivity** , select **FastConnect**.
  2. Find the connection in the list, click the the Actions menu (![Actions Menu](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/libraries/global-images/actions-menu.png)), and then click **Move Resource**.
  3. Choose the destination compartment from the list. 
  4. Click **Move Resource**.
  5. If there are alarms monitoring the connection, update the alarms to reference the new compartment. See [Updating an Alarm After Moving a Resource](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Tasks/update-alarm-after-resource-move.htm) for more information.
