# Network Security Group Management
Describes how to create and manage NSGs that can be used to restrict traffic flow to and from resources such as compute instances.
For the purposes of management access control, you must specify the compartment and VCN where you want the NSG to reside. Consult an administrator in your organization if you're not sure which compartment and VCN to use. For information about compartments and access control, see [Managing Compartments](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/compartments/managingcompartments.htm).
The following management actions are available for VCNs and subnets:
