# Limits on Identity Domains
Each identity domain type is associated with a different set of features and object limits.
See [IAM Identity Domain Types](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/sku/overview.htm#overview "Learn about identity domain types and the features and limits associated with each.") for object limits, rate limits, and meters for each identity domain type.
For a list of applicable limits and [instructions for requesting a limit increase](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/servicelimits.htm#Requesti), see [Service Limits](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/servicelimits.htm). To set compartment-specific limits on a resource or resource family, administrators can use [compartment quotas](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Quotas/Concepts/resourcequotas.htm).
