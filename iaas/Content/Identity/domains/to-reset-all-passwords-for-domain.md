# Resetting All Passwords for an Identity Domain
Force all users and administrators in an identity domain in IAM, including the identity domain administrators, to reset their password for the identity domain. After you select to reset the passwords, users and administrators receive an email notification requesting them to reset their passwords.
  1. On the **Domains** list page, under **List scope** , select the compartment that contains the identity domain for which you want to reset all passwords. If you need help finding the list page, see [Listing Identity Domains](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/domains/to-view-identity-domains.htm#view-identity-domains "Retrieve a list of the identity domains in a specific compartment in a tenancy in IAM.").
  2. Select the name of the identity domain.
  3. Select **Reset all passwords**.
  4. Confirm resetting all passwords for the identity domain.
