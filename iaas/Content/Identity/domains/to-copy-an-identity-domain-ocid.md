# Copying an Identity Domain's OCID
Copy an identity domain's OCID so that you can, for example, paste it in the search field when searching for resources related to an OCID in a tenancy in IAM. 
  1. On the **Domains** list page, under **List scope** , select the compartment that contains the identity domain from which you want to copy the OCID. If you need help finding the list page, see [Listing Identity Domains](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/domains/to-view-identity-domains.htm#view-identity-domains "Retrieve a list of the identity domains in a specific compartment in a tenancy in IAM.").
  2. Select the name of the identity domain.
  3. On the **Domain information** tab, next to the **OCID** field, select **Copy**.
The OCID is copied to the clipboard.
