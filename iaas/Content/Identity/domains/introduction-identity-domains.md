# Introduction
Learn about the Default identity domain, how to use several domains, disaster recovery and domains, and more.
The introduction contains the following topics:
  * [The Default Identity Domain](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/domains/the_default_domain.htm#the_default_domain "Each tenancy includes a Default identity domain in the root compartment.")
  * [Using Multiple Identity Domains](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/domains/multiple-domains.htm#multiple-instances "Create and manage multiple identity domains \(for example, one domain for development and one for production\) each with different identity and security requirements to protect your applications and Oracle Cloud services.")
  * [Limits on Identity Domains](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/domains/limits_on_domains.htm#limits_on_domains "Each identity domain type is associated with a different set of features and object limits.")
  * [Recovering Domains](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/domains/recovering_domains.htm#recovering_domains "Administrators can't recover a deleted identity domain.")
  * [Disaster Recovery and Identity Domains](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/domains/disaster_recovery_and_domains.htm#disaster_recovery_and_domains "A disaster can be any event that puts applications at risk, for example failures caused by natural disasters. In regions with cross-region disaster recovery \(DR\) enabled, identity domains have built-in cross-region DR to minimize data loss. Data for a region is replicated to a nearby region in the event of a disaster. If an entire OCI region becomes unavailable, traffic is routed to the disaster recovery region to speed service recovery and retain as much data as possible. Oracle pairs regions with disaster recovery \(DR\) regions for you.")
  * [Managing High Availability for Sign-in to the Console](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/domains/manage-replicated-regions-identitydomain.htm#iam-high-availability-console-signin "Maximize High Availability for the Console by replicating identity domains in other regions. Replicating identity domains lets users sign in to the Console when the home region is unavailable.")
