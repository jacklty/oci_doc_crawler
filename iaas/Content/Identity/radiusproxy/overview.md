# Setting Up RADIUS Proxy 
Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) is a network protocol that defines rules and conventions for communication between network devices. RADIUS Proxy authenticates and authorizes users or devices and also tracks the usage of those services.
## Required Policy or Role ðŸ”— 
To set up and validate RADIUS Proxy, you must have one of the following access grants:
  * Be a member of the Administrators group
  * Be granted the Identity Domain Administrator role or the Security Administrator role
  * Be a member of a group granted `manage` domains


To understand more about policies and roles, see [The Administrators Group, Policy, and Administrator Roles](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/getstarted/identity-domains.htm#The), [Understanding Administrator Roles](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/roles/understand-administrator-roles.htm#understand-administrator-roles "Learn about administrator roles and the privileges associated with each role so that you can delegate administrative tasks to other users, as needed."), and [IAM Policies Overview](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/policieshow/Policy_Basics.htm#top "IAM policies govern control of resources in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure \(OCI\) tenancies.").
## Setting up RADIUS Proxy ðŸ”— 
Install, setup, and test RADIUS Proxy.
Before You Begin**:**
  * Ensure that your RADIUS Proxy is available for your identity domain. RADIUS Proxy is available only for Oracle Apps Premium and Premium Identity Domain Types. To learn about identity domain types and the features and limits associated with each, see [IAM Identity Domain Types](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/sku/overview.htm#overview "Learn about identity domain types and the features and limits associated with each.").
  * Install the latest [Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/installation-and-updates/) client.
  * Download the [RADIUS Proxy Postman collection](https://github.com/oracle/idm-samples/blob/master/idcs-rest-clients/Oracle%20Identity%20Cloud%20Service%20RADIUS%20Proxy.postman_collection.json).
  * Review the RADIUS Proxy mapping instructions. See [RADIUS Proxy Mapping](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/radiusproxy/overview.htm#radius-proxy-mapping "RADIUS Proxy and RADIUS Proxy Listener has a 1-1 mapping, for example for each RADIUS Proxy there is one RADIUS Proxy Listener. Multiple Oracle DB RADIUS clients can be mapped to one RADIUS Proxy, that is, a RADIUS Proxy has a 1-n mapping with Oracle DB RADIUS clients.").
  * Review these checkpoints. As you're setting up RADIUS Proxy, use the following checkpoints to verify that your configuration is correct at each step of the process. 
    1. Check that the RADIUS Proxy and the RADIUS Proxy Client App are activated in the identity domain.
    2. Check the IP address of Database and port number of RADIUS Proxy are correctly configured in the RADIUS App.
    3. Check that the RADIUS Agent is up and running.
    4. Check that the proxy server is up and running.
    5. Check that the database is up.


  1. Download the latest RADIUS Proxy Installer from the Downloads page in the Console.
    1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Domains**.Click the name of the identity domain that you want to work in. You might need to change the compartment to find the domain that you want. Then, click **Settings** and then **Downloads**.
    2. Choose **Oracle Identity Cloud Service RADIUS Proxy for Linux** , and then select **Download**.
  2. Create the RADIUS App from the RADIUS App Template. Note: For REST go to **RADIUS Proxy** , **RADIUS App** , **Search** , and then **Search all apps** (with search criteria).
    1. In the Console, select **Applications** , **Add** , and then **App Catalog**.
    2. Search for the **Oracle Database Radius App Template** and select **Add**.
    3. Complete the App details similar to the following example.
       * **Name:** dbserver
       * **Description:** App representing the Oracle database server as a RADIUS client
       * **IP Address of Oracle Database server:** 10.242.230.122 (This IP address is where the database is installed.)
       * **Port of RADIUS Proxy:** 1812 (The port number on which RADIUS Proxy listens for requests from this Oracle database. The same port number must be configured in the RADIUS settings of Oracle Database.)
       * **Secret key:** testing123 (The secret key used to secure communication between RADIUS Proxy and the Oracle Database server. The same key must be configured in the RADIUS settings of Oracle Database.)
    4. Select **Add** , **Activate** , and then select the **Users** tab.
**Note**
Assign the users who are allowed to sign in to Oracle Database, to this Radius App by selecting **Assign Users**. Instead of assigning individual users, a Group which contains those users, can also be assigned. Select the Groups tab, and then **Assign Groups**.
Note : Create the group name in the identity domain according to the following format defined in Step 3C: Configure the RADIUS Server in [Configuring RADIUS Authentication](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/DBSEG/asoradus.htm#GUID-78799317-4902-43D7-8EB2-5645F731F530): `ORA_databaseSID_rolename[_[A]|[D]]`.
For every role in Oracle database to be identified by IAM, create a corresponding group using the format above. Assign a user to this group in IAM so that the respective database user is associated with the respective database role.
  3. Create a RADIUS Proxy in IAM. 
    1. Register a Client Application. See [Register a Client Application](https://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/obe/cloud/idcs/idcs_rest_postman_obe/rest_postman.html#RegisteraClientApplication). 
    2. Open Postman and import the [ RADIUS Proxy.postman_collection.json](https://github.com/oracle/idm-samples/blob/master/idcs-rest-clients/Oracle%20Identity%20Cloud%20Service%20RADIUS%20Proxy.postman_collection.json) collection to make the REST requests in this section.
    3. Import the [ RADIUS Proxy Example Environment with Variables.postman_environment.json](https://github.com/oracle/idm-samples/blob/master/idcs-rest-clients/Oracle%20Identity%20Cloud%20Service%20RADIUS%20Proxy%20Example%20Environment%20with%20Variables.postman_environment.json) environment file which contains the environment variables used in the collection.
    4. Set the following environment variables.
For **HOST** , use the IAM address, for example, <https://yourtenant.identity.oraclecloud.com/>.
For **CLIENT_ID** and **CLIENT_SECRET** , use the values that you copied above.
**Note** Other environment variables are automatically set when REST requests are made. Ensure that following REST requests are made in the same order.
    5. Obtain an access token. To make API calls to IAM, you must authenticate your client against IAM, and then obtain an OAuth access token. The access token provides a session between a client (in this case, Postman) and IAM. By default, the access token has a timeout interval of 60 minutes, and then you must request a new access token to perform additional REST API calls. To obtain an OAuth access token, make the request in the Postman collection under **RADIUS Proxy** , **OAuth Token** , and then **Obtain access_token (client credentials)**.
    6. Create the RADIUS Proxy by using a POST Operation. Go to **RADIUS Proxy** , **Create** , and then **Create a RADIUS Proxy**.
End point: `admin/v1/RadiusProxies/ {{RPid}}`
```
{ 
"displayName": "**Acme RADIUS Proxy**", 
"description": "This is a RADIUS Proxy used for authentication of database users", 
"type":
"proxy", 
"timeout": 20, 
"noOfWorkerThreads": 10, 
"schemas" :
["urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:oracle:idcs:RadiusProxy"] 
}
```

    7. Use this Patch Operation to activate the RADIUS Proxy. Go to **RADIUS Proxy** , **Lifecycle** , and then **Activate a RADIUS Proxy**.
End point: `/admin/v1/RadiusProxies/{{RPid}}`
```
{ 
"Operations":[ 
{ 
"op": "replace",
"path": "active", 
"value": true 
} ],
"schemas": [
"urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:PatchOp" ] }
```

    8. Create the RADIUS Proxy Listener using a POST Operation. Go to **RADIUS Proxy** , **RADIUS Proxy Listeners** , **Create** , and then **Create a RADIUS Proxy Listener**.
End point: `{{HOST}}/admin/v1/RadiusProxyListeners`
```
{ 
"description": "Brief description for this RADIUS Proxy Listener.",
"displayName": "RP1_L1", 
"hostName": "<HostName of the machine in which RADIUS Proxy will be installed.>", 
"radiusProxySettings":"{\"key1\": \"value1\", \"key2\": \"value2\"}", 
"radiusProxy":
{ "value" : "<ID of RadiusProxy which is created above.>" 
}, 
"schemas" : ["urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:oracle:idcs:RadiusProxyListener"]
}
```

    9. Get the `dbserver` App ID. Perform a GET call on `admin/v1/Apps?filter=displayName eq "dbserver"`. Fetch the App ID from the response of this GET call. Go to **RADIUS Proxy** , **RADIUS App** , **Search** , and then **Search all apps (with search criteria)**. 
You can also get the App ID from the URL of the `dbserver`.
    10. Create a RADIUS Proxy Mapping using a POST Operation. Go to **RADIUS Proxy** , **RADIUS Proxy Mappings** , **Create** , and then **Create a RADIUS Proxy Mapping**.
End point: `{{HOST}}/admin/v1/RadiusProxyMappings/`
**Note** For "value" below, the ID is the ID of Radius Proxy which you created above. 
```
{
"description": "RADIUS Proxy mapping for Database server",
"radiusProxy": {
"value" : "<RadiusProxyID>"
},
"radiusApp": {
"value": "<<ID of RADIUS App obtained above.>"
},
"schemas" : ["urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:oracle:idcs:RadiusProxyMapping"]
}

```

For RADIUS Proxy mapping instructions, see [RADIUS Proxy Mapping](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/radiusproxy/overview.htm#radius-proxy-mapping "RADIUS Proxy and RADIUS Proxy Listener has a 1-1 mapping, for example for each RADIUS Proxy there is one RADIUS Proxy Listener. Multiple Oracle DB RADIUS clients can be mapped to one RADIUS Proxy, that is, a RADIUS Proxy has a 1-n mapping with Oracle DB RADIUS clients.").
    11. GET `client_id` and `clientSecret` of the RADIUS Proxy. The `client_id` and `clientSecret` are required during RADIUS Proxy installation. RADIUS Proxy uses these credentials to authenticate with IAM. Go to **RADIUS Proxy** , **Search** , **Create** , **Get client ID, and client secret of the App corresponding to RADIUS Proxy**.
End point: `{{HOST}}/admin/v1/Apps/{{RPOAuthClientAppId}}?attributes=clientSecret,name`
`RPOAuthClientAppId`: is the ID of the App corresponding to RADIUS Proxy. You can find it in the response [response.oauthClient.value] in step 3f, _Create a RADIUS Proxy Mapping using a POST Operation_.
Response:```
{
"isAliasApp": false,
"basedOnTemplate": {
"value": "RadiusProxyAppTemplateId"
},
"displayName": "Acme RADIUS Proxy",**
"name": "<client id>"**,
"id": "75d525ce49ee469ba4dcac00bdfe6446",
**"clientSecret": "<client secret>"
**}

```

  4. Run the Installer.
    1. Unzip the downloaded `idcs_radius_proxy-xxxx.zip` file into a folder.
    2. Name the folder `<radius bin location-xxxx>`. Where `xxxx` is the version number (for example, 20.1.3).
Three files are extracted: **FileInfo.json** , **idcs_radius_proxy_installer.bin** , and **InstallerValidation.jar**. The **InstallerValidation.jar** file and the **idcs_radius_proxy_installer.bin** file are located in the same directory post extraction. They must remain in the same directory. 
    3. Login as root user or run the following command as sudo: `./idcs_radius_proxy_installer.bin`
**Note** The installer supports only Graphical User Interface mode. It does not support console mode. So, if you see the error: "`Graphical installers are not supported by the VM.`", then ensure _X server_ is configured properly. Then, run this command as non root user : `xhost +si:localuser:root` and run installer again.
  5. Install RADIUS Proxy.
    1. Read the Welcome screen, and then select **Next**.
    2. Read the Information screen, and then select **Next**.
    3. Select the **Destination Folder** (default is `/root/oracle_radius_proxy`), where the RADIUS Proxy installer will be installed. Select **Next**.
    4. On the HTTP Proxy screen, select **Use HTTP Proxy** if RADIUS Proxy needs to use HTTP proxy to connect to IAM. If not, then leave this checkbox unchecked. Select **Next**.
    5. On the IAM screen, enter the **Cloud Service URL** in the following format: `https://yourtenant.identity.oraclecloud.com`. Provide the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** of the RADIUS Proxy created in IAM. (This is the RADIUS Proxy you created using the POST Operation above.) Select **Next**.
    6. On the RADIUS User and Group Information screen, provide the **Username** and user **Group** information, for example:
       * **Username** : <client>
       * **Group** : <dba>
IAM RADIUS Proxy daemon will run under the specified username and group.
    7. Select **Next**.
    8. On the preinstall screen, verify that all the information is correct. If the information is correct, select **Install**.
    9. When the installation is complete, select **Done**.
  6. Check that the RADIUS Agent and RADIUS Proxy are running. The RADIUS Agent obtains configuration data from IAM at regular intervals. Then, it updates the configuration files used by RADIUS Proxy. 
    1. Use the following RADIUS Agent commands to check whether the agent is running:
       * `python <RADIUS_PROXY_INSTALLER_LOCATION>/oracle_radius_proxy/radius_agent/scripts/src/radius_agent.py status`
       * You can also use `stop`, `start` and `restart` if needed. 
    2. Use the following command to run RADIUS Proxy: ` /sbin/service idcs_radiusd start`
    3. Run these RADIUS server commands to verify that the RADIUS service isRADIUS running.
       * `/sbin/service idcs_radiusd status`
       * You can also use `stop`, `start`, and `restart` if needed. 
  7. (Optional) Use the NTRadPing Test Utility to validate that RADIUS proxy is working.
    1. Install the NTRadPing Test Utility in Windows, and then create a User in IAM.
    2. Use the below screenshot as an example. In the below screenshot **client** is the user created in IAM and **testing123** is the secret key given in RADIUS Settings, **Secret key** of **App Details** page.
The following image shows the NTRadPing test utility in Windows:
![Screenshot of NTRadPing Test Utility in Windows](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Resources/Images/iam-radiusntradeping.png)
  8. Set up and Configure Oracle Database 12c. Follow the instructions at [Configuring Authentication](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/DBSEG/asoradus.htm#DBSEG040) and then use the following commands to create a user/role in the database.
  9. Set up and Configure Oracle Database 12c. For more information, see [Configuring RADIUS Authentication](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/DBSEG/asoradus.htm#DBSEG040). Follow the instructions in the _Configuring RADIUS Authentication_ section to create a user and role in the database.
  10. You can't add an IP address in CIDR format using the IAM user interface. If the IP address of the Oracle Database is in CIDR format, use the following request from the Postman collection. See [Change an IP Address from CIDR Format](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/known-issues/known-issues-radius-proxy.htm#unique_1282617458).
  11. Set up MFA. To set up MFA follow these instructions, see [Managing Multifactor Authentication](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/mfa/understand-multi-factor-authentication.htm#understand-multi-factor-authentication "Multifactor Authentication \(MFA\) is a method of authentication that requires the use of more than one factor to verify a user's identity to access an identity domain in IAM.").

Client Configuration | <radius_proxy_installer_location>/radius_proxy/conf/radius_clients.conf  
## RADIUS Proxy Mapping ðŸ”— 
RADIUS Proxy and RADIUS Proxy Listener has a 1-1 mapping, for example for each RADIUS Proxy there is one RADIUS Proxy Listener. Multiple Oracle DB RADIUS clients can be mapped to one RADIUS Proxy, that is, a RADIUS Proxy has a 1-n mapping with Oracle DB RADIUS clients.
If an administrator configures multiple Oracle DB RADIUS clients, then that many Oracle Database RADIUS apps need to be created in IAM identity domains-one for each Oracle DB RADIUS client. For example, if an administrator has configured four Oracle DB RADIUS clients to one RADIUS Proxy, then in IAM identity domains there must be four Oracle Database RADIUS apps configured-one for each Oracle DB client.
