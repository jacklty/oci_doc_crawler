# Adding an Account to the OMA App by Scanning the QR Code
If you skipped MFA enrollment during sign in, use the Oracle Mobile Authenticator (OMA) app to link the app to an account in an MFA-protected identity domain by scanning the quick response (QR) code.
**Before You Begin**
  1. Download the OMA app if you haven't already. See [Downloading the Oracle Mobile Authenticator App](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/mobileauthapp/download-mobile-authenticator-app.htm#download-mobile-authenticator-app "You can download the Oracle Mobile Authenticator \(OMA\) app during two-factor enrollment or you can download it before you're prompted for two-factor enrollment so that you can add accounts to the app without downloading it during enrollment.").
  2. Access the Console using your desktop. **Note:** If you don't know how to access the Console, look for the link in your Welcome email. 
  3. In the navigation bar, select the **Profile** menu and then select **User settings** or **My profile** , depending on the option that you see.
  4. Select the **Security** tab.
  5. In the 2-step verification section, in Mobile app, select **Configure**.
The Console displays the Authentication QR code. Leave the Console open.

To add an account to the OMA app by scanning the QR code, complete the following steps:
  1. Open the OMA app on your mobile device, and then tap **Add account** (plus sign).
  2. Scan the QR code that displays on the Console.
After setup is complete, you'll see the account added to the OMA app, and you will also see the Mobile app tile in the Console.
