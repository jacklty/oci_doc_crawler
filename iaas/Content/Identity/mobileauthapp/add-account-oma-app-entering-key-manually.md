# Adding an Account to the OMA App by Entering the Key Manually
If you skipped MFA enrollment during sign in, use the Oracle Mobile Authenticator (OMA) app to link the app to an account in an MFA-protected identity domain by entering the key manually.
**Before You Begin**
  1. Download the OMA app if you haven't already. See [Downloading the Oracle Mobile Authenticator App](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/mobileauthapp/download-mobile-authenticator-app.htm#download-mobile-authenticator-app "You can download the Oracle Mobile Authenticator \(OMA\) app during two-factor enrollment or you can download it before you're prompted for two-factor enrollment so that you can add accounts to the app without downloading it during enrollment.").
  2. Access the Console using your desktop. **Note:** If you don't know how to access the Console, look for the link in your Welcome email. 
  3. In the navigation bar, select the **Profile** menu and then select **User settings** or **My profile** , depending on the option that you see.
  4. Select the **Security** tab.
  5. In the 2-step verification section, in Mobile app, select **Configure**.
The Console displays the Authentication QR code.
  6. On the **Mobile application** page, select the **Offline mode or use another authenticator app** checkbox, and then select **Enter key manually**.
The enrollment instructions on the page switch to configuring the OMA app manually. Leave the Console open.

To add an account to the OMA app by entering the key manually, complete the following steps:
  1. Open the OMA app on your mobile device, and then tap **Add account** (plus sign).
  2. Tap **Enter key manually**.
  3. Select **Oracle** as the Account Type, and then enter your username as the **Account,** which is typically your email address.
  4. Enter the key from the Mobile application page in the Console, and then tap **Save.**
  5. After setup is complete, the OMA app displays a one-time passcode (OTP) for your account. Enter that OTP on the Mobile application page in the Console.
  6. Select **Verify.**
After setup is complete, you'll see the account added to the OMA app, and you will also see the Mobile app tile in the Console.
