# Registering New And Reregistering Existing Mobile Devices
Register Oracle Mobile Authenticator (OMA) with a new mobile device if you already have OMA registered on one mobile device and need to register it on a new mobile device. Reregister OMA with an existing mobile device if you started the OMA registration process but the process didn't complete and you're receiving an error when trying to use OMA. In both cases, you must contact an identity domain administrator.
Whether registering a new device (for example, if you lost your phone) or reregistering an existing device, an identity domain administrator must reset your authentication factors. Resetting your authentication factors restarts the enrollment process requiring you to configure the authentication factors again. If you can't contact your administrator, you need to contact support. If you need help contacting support, see [Creating a Support Request](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/GSG/support/create-incident.htm).
**Note** Administrators: For information about resetting authentication factors for user accounts, see [Resetting Authentication Factors for User Accounts](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/users/reset-authentication-factors-user-accounts.htm#top "Describes how to reset all verification factors for a user in an OCI IAM identity domain if the user's device can't be used to provide a second factor for authentication, for example, if the user's device is lost or the Oracle Mobile Authenticator app has been deleted from the device.").
## Registering a New Device
If you already have OMA registered on one mobile device and need to register it with a new device, you must have your authentication factors reset by an identity domain administrator before registering the new device.
To register OMA with a new mobile device, complete the following steps: 
  1. If possible, uninstall OMA from the existing mobile device.
  2. Contact your identity domain administrator and ask to have your authentication factors reset. 
**Tip** If you need help contacting your administrator, see _Contacting Your Administrator_ in the [Contacting Support](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/GSG/Tasks/signinginIdentityDomain.htm#contacting_support) section.
  3. Sign out of the Console.
  4. Access the Console. 
  5. Set up the new authentication factors and then follow the instructions to register the new device.


## Reregistering an Existing Device
If you already have OMA registered on an existing mobile device but need to reregister it because it's not working, you must have your authentication factors reset by an identity domain administrator before reregistering the device.
To register OMA with an existing mobile device, complete the following steps:
  1. Uninstall OMA from the existing mobile device.
  2. Contact your identity domain administrator and ask to have your authentication factors reset. 
**Tip** If you need help contacting your administrator, see _Contacting Your Administrator_ in the [Contacting Support](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/GSG/Tasks/signinginIdentityDomain.htm#contacting_support) section.
