# Downloading the Oracle Mobile Authenticator App
You can download the Oracle Mobile Authenticator (OMA) app during two-factor enrollment or you can download it before you're prompted for two-factor enrollment so that you can add accounts to the app without downloading it during enrollment.
To download the OMA app without enrollment, complete the following steps:
  1. Go to the device's app store: 
    1. For iOS, go to [Apple App Store](https://www.apple.com/app-store/). 
    2. For Android, go to [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps).
    3. For Windows, go to the [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/).
  2. Search for **Oracle Mobile Authenticator** and then download and install it.


You should see the OMA app icon on your mobile device.
