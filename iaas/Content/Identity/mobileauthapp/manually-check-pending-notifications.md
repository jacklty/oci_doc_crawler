# Manually Checking for Pending Notifications
Oracle Mobile Authenticator (OMA) app automatically checks for authentication requests, but you can also manually check for your pending notifications.
How to check for pending notifications depends on which view you are using in the OMA app:
  1. While in List View, pull down on the account list to check for any pending notifications for all accounts in the list. If there is a pending notification, it automatically appears. Tap **Allow** or **Deny.**
  2. While in Grid View, pull down on an account tile to check for pending notifications for that account. If there is a pending notification, it automatically appears. Tap **Allow** or **Deny.**
The number of notifications that require your attention also appear on the bell icon in the upper-right corner. Tap the bell icon to access the **Notification History** screen, tap a pending notification, and then tap **Allow** or **Deny.**
