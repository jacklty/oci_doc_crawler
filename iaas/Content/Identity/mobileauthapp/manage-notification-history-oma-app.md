# Managing Notification History in the OMA App
You can access and view details about your notification history in the Oracle Mobile Authenticator (OMA) app.
  1. Launch the OMA app and tap the bell icon in the upper-right corner to launch the **Notifications** page. Alternatively, you can tap the menu icon in the upper-left corner and tap **Notifications.** The Notification History page displays all notifications for the account.
For the iOS platform, pending notifications that are currently in the Notification center of your device don't appear in the OMA app when you manually launch the OMA app.
  2. The **Pending** tab displays notifications for login requests that require you to either allow or deny the request. Tap a notification to view login request details.
  3. The **History** tab displays notifications for login requests that you already addressed. To clear the history, tap **Clear** in the upper-right corner of the **History** tab and tap **Clear** again at the prompt.
