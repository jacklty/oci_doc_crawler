# Overview of the Oracle Mobile Authenticator App
The Oracle Mobile Authenticator (OMA) app is a mobile device app that you can use as a second verification method by tapping **Allow** on the login request notification sent to your phone or by using the one-time passcode (OTP) that the app generates.
A mobile authenticator app uses either OTP or push notifications to prove that the user has possession of the mobile device. Only the mobile authenticator app that is in possession of the user's secret key can generate a valid OTP. You can download the Oracle Mobile Authenticator app from the app store.
