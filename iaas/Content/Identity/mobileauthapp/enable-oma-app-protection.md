# Enabling App Protection
Add an another level of security to the Oracle Mobile Authenticator (OMA) app by using an app PIN, by using biometrics such as Touch ID or Fingerprint, and by using Screen Protection to protect the app.
OMA app PIN protection requires a PIN to unlock app before you can generate a one-time passcode (OTP) or approve a notification. Biometric protection requires Touch ID or Fingerprint verification to unlock the App before you can generate an OTP or approve a notification. Screen Protection, enabled by default, prevents OMA App content from being captured by screen recording.
The OMA app doesn't support biometrics using a Windows device, and Touch ID with the OMA app is only supported with iOS version 8 and later.
  1. To enable an app PIN:
Your application might require you to set up a PIN when you enroll.
    1. Open the OMA app, and then tap the menu icon in the upper-left corner.
    2. Tap **App Protection.**
    3. Tap to enable PIN or Touch ID protection for the OMA app.
    4. Enter your PIN at the prompt, enter it again to verify, and then tap **OK.** The next time that you access the OMA app, you're prompted to enter your PIN.
  2. To enable Biometrics, for example, fingerprint, facial ID, or touch ID:
When you initially enable Touch IDFingerprint, you're prompted to set your PIN if you haven't. If you have set your PIN, you're prompted to enter your PIN first before enabling Touch ID or Fingerprint.
    1. Open the OMA app, and then tap the menu icon in the upper-left corner.
    2. Tap **App Protection.**
    3. Tap to enable the biometric protection option for the OMA app.
    4. Enter your PIN at the prompt.
    5. Enter your PIN again to verify and tap **OK.**
The next time that you open the App, you're prompted to use your fingerprint to gain access to the OMA app.
  3. To disable Screen Protection:
Screen Protection prevents OMA App content from being captured by screen recording (iOS only), AirPlay (iOS only), or Screen Mirroring and is enabled by default. Screen protection is available in iOS version 11 and later. Your application might require you to set up a PIN when you enroll.
    1. Open the OMA app, and then tap the menu icon in the upper-left corner.
    2. Tap **App Protection.**
    3. Tap to disable Screen Protection for the App.
