  3. In your user profile page, select your user name. 
  4. Under **Resources** , select **Database Passwords.**
  5. In the **Database Passwords** section, select **Create Database Password.**
The **Create Database Password** dialog box is displayed.
  6. Enter a description of the password.
  7. Note the password guidelines and restrictions listed on the page. See [Creating an IAM database password](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/usercredentials.htm#usercredentials_topic_creating_a_database_password "You can manage your own IAM database password with the Console, including creating, changing and deleting it.") for more information about password rules.
