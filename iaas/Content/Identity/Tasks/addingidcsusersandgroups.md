# Managing Oracle Identity Cloud Service Users and Groups in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console
This topic describes how to use the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console to manage your Oracle Identity Cloud Service users and groups. Before you get started, understand basic federation concepts. See [Federating with Identity Providers](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/federation.htm#top).
## Overview of Working with Oracle Identity Cloud Service Users and Groups in the Console ðŸ”— 
The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console provides an integration with Oracle Identity Cloud Service (IDCS) that lets you perform many management tasks for your IDCS users and groups in the Console. 
**User Management Tasks**
In the Console, you can do the following user management tasks:
  * Add users
  * Remove users
  * Add users to groups
  * Assign roles to users to access services and instances
  * Reset user password


For information on more user management tasks, see [Managing Oracle Identity Cloud Service Users](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/identity-cloud/uaids/manage-oracle-identity-cloud-service-users1.html) in _Administering Oracle Identity Cloud Service_.
**Group Management Tasks**
In the Console, you can do the following group management tasks:
  * Add groups
  * Remove groups
  * Add users to groups
  * Map IDCS groups to IAM groups


For information on more group management tasks, see [Managing Oracle Identity Cloud Service Groups](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/identity-cloud/uaids/manage-oracle-identity-cloud-service-groups1.html) in _Administering Oracle Identity Cloud Service_.
## Required Policies and Permissions ðŸ”— 
To manage Oracle Identity Cloud Service users and groups in the Console, you'll need to be granted permissions in both the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure IAM service and in Oracle Identity Cloud Service.
Members of the OCI_Administrators group have the required permissions to create groups and policies in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. 
**Important:** To create users and groups in the Oracle Identity Cloud Service federation, you'll need the Identity Domain Administrator role, or be a member of a group that has been granted that role. For information on Oracle Identity Cloud Service roles, see [Administering Oracle Identity Cloud Service](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/identity-cloud/uaids/understand-administrator-roles.html).
To quickly create a user with the required permissions, see [Add a User with Oracle Cloud Administrator Permissions](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/GSG/Tasks/addingusers.htm#Add).
## Navigating to Your Oracle Identity Cloud Service Users and Groups in the Console ðŸ”— 
In the Console, you can add users and groups to Oracle Identity Cloud Service from the Identity Provider Details page.
To view your identity provider details:
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Federation**.
  2. Click your Oracle Identity Cloud Service federation. For most tenancies, the federation is named **OracleIdentityCloudService**. The identity provider details page is displayed. 


[![This screenshot shows the Oracle Identity Cloud Service Federation Details page](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Resources/Images/iam_provider_details.png)](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Resources/Images/iam_provider_details.png)
From the Identity Provider Details page, select **Users** to display the users created in Oracle Identity Cloud Service. Select **Groups** to display the groups created in Oracle Identity Cloud Service.
## Working with Oracle Identity Cloud Service Groups ðŸ”— 
The Console lets you perform the following tasks to manage groups in Oracle Identity Cloud Service:
  * Add groups
  * Delete groups
  * Edit the name and description
  * Add users to groups
  * Remove users from groups
  * Map groups to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure groups


Some tasks you can't perform in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console. To add the predefined application roles for some Oracle Cloud products, you need to assign roles in the Identity Cloud Service console. For more information about using Oracle Identity Cloud Service, see [Administering Oracle Identity Cloud Service](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/identity-cloud/uaids/understand-administrator-roles.html).
For the members of a group in Oracle Identity Cloud Service to have permissions in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, you must map the IDCS group to a group in IAM. Before you set up any new groups in IDCS, ensure that you understand how to assign permissions to groups in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. See [Overview of Identity and Access Management](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm#Overview_of_Oracle_Cloud_Infrastructure_Identity_and_Access_Management).
## Working with Oracle Identity Cloud Service Users ðŸ”— 
The Console lets you perform the following tasks to manage users in Oracle Identity Cloud Service:
  * Add users
  * Delete users
  * Edit user details
  * Add users to groups
  * Add roles to users
  * Remove users from groups
  * Reset user passwords 


### User Management Tasks You Can't Perform in the Console
The Oracle Cloud Console does not support management of the following Oracle Identity Cloud Service user features and tasks: 
  * Manage multifactor authentication


For information about managing these tasks, see [Administering Oracle Identity Cloud Service](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/identity-cloud/uaids/understand-administrator-roles.html).
## Managing Oracle Identity Cloud Service Groups in the Console ðŸ”—

[Create a policy to grant the group permissions on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/addingidcsusersandgroups.htm)
The group you created in Oracle Identity Cloud Service gets permissions to access resources in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure through the policy you assign to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure group. Before you complete this step, you need to decide what permissions you want to give your new group. For more information, see [Getting Started with Policies](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm#Getting_Started_with_Policies) and [Common Policies](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/commonpolicies.htm#top).
Prerequisite: The group and compartment that you're writing the policy for must already exist.
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Policies**. A list of the policies in the compartment you're viewing is displayed.
  2. If you want to attach the policy to a compartment other than the one you're viewing, select the desired compartment from the list on the left. Where the policy is attached controls who can later modify or delete it (see [Policy Attachment](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/policies.htm#Policy3)).
  3. Select **Create Policy**. 
  4. Enter the following: 
     * **Name:** A unique name for the policy. The name must be unique across all policies in your tenancy. You cannot change this later. Avoid entering confidential information.
     * **Description:** A friendly description. You can change this later if you want to.
     * **Statement:** A policy statement. For the correct format to use, see [Policy Basics](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/policies.htm#Policy) and also [Policy Syntax](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/policysyntax.htm#Policy_Syntax). If you want to add more than one statement, select **+**. 
For example:
To allow your group to manage all resources within a specified compartment enter a statement like the following:
Copy
```
Allow group <OCI_group_name> to manage all-resources in compartment <compartment_name>
```

For more policy examples, see [Common Policies](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/commonpolicies.htm#top).
     * **Tags:** If you have permissions to create a resource, then you also have permissions to apply free-form tags to that resource. To apply a defined tag, you must have permissions to use the tag namespace. For more information about tagging, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). If you're not sure whether to apply tags, skip this option or ask an administrator. You can apply tags later.
  5. Select **Create**. 


## Managing Oracle Identity Cloud Service Users in the Console ðŸ”— 
After you add a user in Oracle Identity Cloud Service, a user is also automatically provisioned in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. This provisioned user can have the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure credentials, such as API keys and auth tokens. To understand this provisioning, see [User Provisioning for Federated Users](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/usingscim.htm#User_Provisioning_for_Federated_Users).
[To create a user](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/addingidcsusersandgroups.htm)
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Federation**.
  2. Click your Oracle Identity Cloud Service federation. For most tenancies, the federation is named **OracleIdentityCloudService**. The identity provider details page is displayed. 
  3. Select **Create IDCS User**.
  4. In the **Create IDCS User** dialog enter the following:
     * **User Name** : Enter a unique name or email address for the new user. The value will be the user's login to the Console and must be unique across all other users in your tenancy.
     * **Email** : Enter an email address for this user. The initial sign-in credentials will be sent to this email address.
     * **First Name:** Enter the user's first name.
     * **Last Name:** Enter the user's last name.
     * **Phone Number:** Optionally, enter a phone number.
     * **Groups:** Optionally, select groups to add this user to.
  5. Select **Create User**.


**Important** For the user to have permissions in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, you must assign the user to a group that is mapped to an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure group. Or, if you are also creating a new group, you can perform this mapping later. The user will not be able to sign in to the Console until the mapping is accomplished.
The user creation process generates an email that is sent to the address provided that you entered. The email includes the new user's username and password to use with the Oracle Cloud InfrastructureConsole.
To add API keys, auth tokens, customer secret keys, or SMTP credentials for this user, see [Managing User Capabilities for Federated Users](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingusersfederated.htm#Managing_User_Capabilities_for_Federated_Users).
[To edit a user](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/addingidcsusersandgroups.htm)

  3. Under **Resources** , select **Users**.
The list of existing user groups in the federation is displayed.
  4. Find the user you want to reset the password for and select the name.
The **User Details** page is displayed.
  5. Select **Reset Password**.
The user's password is reset. This user can't access their account until they complete the password reset steps.
  6. Select **Email Password Instructions** to send the password link and instructions to the user.
The password link is good for 24 hours. If the user does not reset their password in time, you can generate a new password link by selecting **Reset Password** for the user again.
