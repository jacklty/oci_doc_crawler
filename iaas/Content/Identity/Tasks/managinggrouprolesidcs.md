# Managing Oracle Identity Cloud Service Roles for Groups
This topic describes managing roles for groups created in Oracle Identity Cloud Service.
## About Group Roles in Oracle Identity Cloud Service ðŸ”— 
You can assign roles to groups to allow access to those Oracle Cloud services that have predefined roles defined in Oracle Identity Cloud Service. You can also grant access just to service instances. 
Services managed through Identity Cloud Service can have two types of predefined roles: 
  * Service access roles - grant access to use the service.
  * Instance access roles - grant access to specific instances of a service. These can only be granted after the instances are created.


For information about more complex role management, see [Manage Oracle Identity Cloud Service Groups](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/identity-cloud/uaids/manage-oracle-identity-cloud-service-groups1.html).
## Available Roles for Each Service ðŸ”— 
Service-specific roles vary from one Oracle Cloud service to another, but they typically include at least one administrator role. See [About Service Administrator Roles](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/get-started/subscriptions-cloud/csgsg/service-administrator-roles.html) for more information about administrator roles. See your service-specific documentation for a description of the predefined roles for that service.
## Required Permissions to Manage Roles ðŸ”— 
Before you can manage roles using the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console, you must be allowed to access the Identity Provider Details page. To access this page, you must belong to a group that is allowed to inspect identity providers. If you are a Cloud Administrator or if you belong to the OCI_Administrators group, this permission is included. To give this permission to non-administrators, you'll need to write policies like the following:
Copy
```
allow group GroupA to {USAGE_BUDGET_READ} in tenancy
allow group GroupA to {USAGE_BUDGET_INSPECT} in tenancy
allow group GroupA to {USAGE_BUDGET_MANAGE} in tenancy
allow group GroupA to {TENANCY_INSPECT} in tenancy
```

where you replace GroupA with the name of the group you want to grant the permission to.
To manage service roles, you must be assigned the Administrator role for that service.

**Managing Group Access to an Instance**
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Federation**.

  3. Select **Groups**.

The list of instances for the selected service is displayed.

  8. To edit more instance roles for this group, repeat steps 6 - 7.
  9. On the **Manage Roles** page, select **Apply Role Settings**.
  10. If you added roles, in the confirmation dialog, select **Send Email to Group** to send an email to each member of the group to notify them of this change. Your email client launches with a default email message to the affected users with information about the access changes. You can send the email as written, or make modifications before sending.
