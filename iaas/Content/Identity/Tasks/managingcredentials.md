# Managing User Credentials
This topic describes the basics of working with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Identity and Access Management (IAM) user credentials. If you're not already familiar with the available credentials, see [User Credentials](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/usercredentials.htm#User_Credentials). 
## Working with Console Passwords and API Keys ðŸ”— 
Each user automatically has the ability to change or reset _their own_ Console password, as well as manage _their own_ API keys. An administrator does not need to create a policy to give a user those abilities.
**Note** Federated users might need to create a policy to modify API keys. For example, users who were provisioned through SCIM.
To manage credentials for users other than yourself, you must be in the Administrators group or some other group that has permission to work with the tenancy. Having permission to work with a compartment within the tenancy is not sufficient. For more information, see [The Administrators Group and Policy](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm#The). 
IAM administrators (or anyone with permission to the tenancy) can use either the Console or the API to manage all aspects of both types of credentials, for themselves and all other users. This includes creating an initial one-time password for a new user, resetting a password, uploading API keys, and deleting API keys. 
Users who are not administrators can manage _their own_ credentials. In the Console, users can:
  * Change or reset their own password.
  * Upload an API key in the Console for their own use (and also delete their own API keys).


And with the API, users can:
  * Reset their own password with [CreateOrResetUIPassword](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/identity/latest/UIPassword/CreateOrResetUIPassword).
  * Upload an additional API key to the IAM service for their own use with [UploadApiKey](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/identity/latest/ApiKey/UploadApiKey) (and also delete their own API keys with [DeleteApiKey](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/identity/latest/ApiKey/DeleteApiKey)). Remember that a user can't use the API to change or delete their own credentials until they themselves upload a key in the Console, or an administrator uploads a key for that user in the Console or the API.


A user can have a maximum of three API keys at a time.
## Working with Auth Tokens ðŸ”— 
**Note** "Auth tokens" were previously named "Swift passwords". Any Swift passwords you had created are now listed in the Console as auth tokens. You can continue to use the existing passwords.
Auth tokens are Oracle-generated token strings that you can use to authenticate with third-party APIs that do no support Oracle Cloud Infrastructure's signature-based authentication. Each user created in the IAM service automatically has the ability to create, update, and delete their own auth tokens in the Console or the API. An administrator does not need to create a policy to give a user those abilities. Administrators (or anyone with permission to the tenancy) also have the ability to manage auth tokens for other users.
Note that you cannot change your auth token to a string of your own choice. The token is always an Oracle-generated string.
Auth tokens do not expire. Each user can have up to two auth tokens at a time. To get an auth token in the Console, see [To create an auth token](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcredentials.htm#create_swift_password). 
### Using an Auth Token with Swift ðŸ”— 
Swift is the OpenStack object store service. If you already have an existing Swift client, you can use it with the Recovery Manager (RMAN) to back up an Oracle Database System (DB System) database to Object Storage. You will need to get an auth token to use as your Swift password. When you sign in to your Swift client, you provide the following:
  * Your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console user login
  * Your Swift-specific auth token, provided by Oracle
  * Your organization's Oracle tenant name


Any user of a Swift client that integrates with Object Storage needs permission to work with the service. If you're not sure if you have permission, contact your administrator. For information about policies, see [How Policies Work](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/policies.htm#How_Policies_Work). For basic policies that enable use of Object Storage, see [Common Policies](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/commonpolicies.htm#top).
## Working with Customer Secret Keys ðŸ”— 
**Note** "Customer Secret keys" were previously named "Amazon S3 Compatibility API keys". Any keys you had created are now listed in the Console as Customer Secret keys. You can continue to use the existing keys.
Object Storage provides an API to enable interoperability with Amazon S3. To use this Amazon S3 Compatibility API, you need to generate the signing key required to authenticate with Amazon S3. This special signing key is an Access Key/Secret Key pair. Oracle provides the Access Key that is associated with your Console user login. You or your administrator generates the Customer Secret key to pair with the Access Key.
Each user created in the IAM service automatically has the ability to create, update, and delete their own Customer Secret keys in the Console or the API. An administrator does not need to create a policy to give a user those abilities. Administrators (or anyone with permission to the tenancy) also have the ability to manage Customer Secret keys for other users. 
Any user of the Amazon S3 Compatibility API with Object Storage needs permission to work with the service. If you're not sure if you have permission, contact your administrator. For information about policies, see [How Policies Work](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/policies.htm#How_Policies_Work). For basic policies that enable use of Object Storage, see [Common Policies](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/commonpolicies.htm#top).
Customer Secret keys do not expire. Each user can have up to two Customer Secret keys at a time. To create keys using the Console, see [To create a Customer Secret key](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcredentials.htm#create-secret-key). 
## Working with OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials ðŸ”— 
**Note** OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials are not available in the United Kingdom Government Cloud (OC4). 
OAuth 2.0 client credentials are required to interact programmatically with those services that use the OAuth 2.0 authorization protocol. The credentials enable you to obtain a secure token to access those service REST API endpoints. The allowed actions and endpoints granted by the token depend on the scopes (permissions) that you select when you generate the credentials. The services that use the OAuth 2.0 protocol are:
  * Oracle Analytics Cloud
  * Oracle Integration


An OAuth 2.0 access token is valid for 3600 seconds (1 hour). 
To create the credentials, you need to know the service resource and scope. Typically, you can select these from a drop-down list. However, if the information is not available in the list, you can manually enter the resource and scope. The scope defines the allowed permissions for the token, so ensure to set the scope at the minimum required access level.
A user can create the credentials for themselves or an Administrator can create the credentials for another user. The lists of available resources and scopes display only those resources and permission levels that the user has been granted access to.
### OAuth 2.0 Client Credential Limits ðŸ”— 
Each user can have up to 10 OAuth 2.0 client credentials. You can increase this limit by [Requesting a Service Limit Increase](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/servicelimits.htm#Requesti).
Each OAuth 2.0 client credential can have up to 10 scopes.
### Obtaining an OAuth 2.0 Access Token  ðŸ”— 
To obtain the token, use your credentials in a request against the OAuth2 token service endpoint as follows: 
  1. Create the OAuth 2.0 client credentials. See [To create OAuth 2.0 client credentials](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcredentials.htm#create-oauth20). 
After you create the OAuth 2.0 client credential note the following information:
     * The generated secret
     * The OCID of the OAuth 2.0 client credential
     * The scope and audience (fully-qualifed scope)
  2. Using the information from the previous step, make a request against the `/oauth2/token` endpoint to obtain a token as follows:
Copy
```
curl -k -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=UTF-8" --user '<Oauth 2.0 client credential OCID>:<credential secret>' https://auth.<oci_region>.oraclecloud.com/oauth2/token -d 'grant_type=client_credentials&scope=<audience>-<scope>'
```



Where: 
  * <Oauth 2.0 client credential OCID>:<credential secret> is the OCID of the OAuth 2.0 client credential that you created joined by a colon (:) with the generated secret for the credential. Note that this secret is only displayed at the time you generate it and it must be copied immediately. You can retrieve the OCID from the details of the credential at any time.
  * ` https://auth.<oci_region>.oraclecloud.com/oauth2/token ` is the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure OAuth 2.0 authorization endpoint where <OCI_region> is a region your tenancy is subscribed to. For example, `us-ashburn-1`.
  * <scope>-<audience> is the fully-qualifed scope, that is, the scope and audience joined by a hyphen (-). The scope and audience are available from the details page of the credential.


Example request:
```
curl -k -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=UTF-8" --user 'ocid1.credential.region1..aaaaaaexamplestringaapgpedxq:{SAMplESeCreta5y' https://auth.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/oauth2/token -d 'grant_type=client_credentials&scope=https://2aexampley3uytc.analytics.ocp.oraclecloud.com-urn:opc:resource:consumer::all'
```

The response will include the token. Example response:
```
{
"access_token" : "eyJraWQiOiJhcDVfwqKdi...8lTILrzc4cof2A",
"token_type" : "Bearer",
"expires_in" : "3600"
}
```

The token string is truncated in the example response. Copy the entire `access_token` string (within the quotation marks) as shown in your response.
### Using the OAuth 2.0 Token in a Request ðŸ”— 
After you obtain an OAuth 2.0 access token, you provide the token in a bearer token header of the REST API request. 
For example:
Copy
```
curl -i -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer <token-string>" "https://<audience>/<rest-endpoint-path>"
```

### What to Do When the Token Expires ðŸ”— 
The token expires after 3600 seconds (1 hour). When the token expires, request a new token following the instructions in [Obtaining an OAuth 2.0 Access Token](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcredentials.htm#topic_tv2_f1x_mmb).
### Adding Scopes ðŸ”— 
You can add scopes to an existing OAuth 2.0 client credential to add access to more services with the same credential. After you add scopes, you do not need to regenerate the secret. 
To request a token for multiple scopes, You can include additional scopes in a token request by appending 
```
&scope=<scope>-<<audience>
```

to the final argument of the request and specifying the scope and audience for the scope you want to add. 
## Working with SMTP Credentials ðŸ”— 
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) credentials are needed in order to send email through the Email Delivery service. Each user is limited to a maximum of two SMTP credentials. If more than two are required, they must be generated on other existing users or additional users must be created.
**Note**
You cannot change your SMTP username or password to a string of your own choice. The credentials are always Oracle-generated strings.
Each user created in the IAM service automatically has the ability to create and delete their own SMTP credentials in the Console or the API. An administrator does not need to create a policy to give a user those abilities. Administrators (or anyone with permission to the tenancy) also have the ability to manage SMTP credentials for other users. 
**Tip** Although each user can create and delete their own credentials, it is a security best practice to create a new user and generate SMTP credentials on this user rather than generating SMTP credentials on your Console user that already has permissions assigned to it.
SMTP credentials do not expire. Each user can have up to two credentials at a time. To get SMTP credentials in the Console, see [To generate SMTP credentials](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcredentials.htm#To5). 
For information about using the Email Delivery service, see [Overview of the Email Delivery Service](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Email/Concepts/overview.htm).
## Working with IAM Database User Names and Passwords ðŸ”— 
### **Easier to use** ðŸ”— 
Database end users can easily use IAM database passwords because they can continue to use a well-known authentication method to access the database. You can access database passwords that you manage through your OCI profile after you successfully authenticate to OCI. 
Before users can access or manage their database password, IAM administrators can create an extra layer of protection by enforcing multifactor authentication using [Managing Multifactor Authentication](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/usingmfa.htm#Managing_MultiFactor_Authentication). For example, this can be a FIDO authenticator, or by pushing notifications through authenticator applications. 
### IAM Database Password Security ðŸ”— 
Using IAM database usernames and IAM database passwords to access databases improves security because they allow IAM administrators to centrally manage users and user access to database passwords within IAM instead of locally in each database. When a user leaves an organization, their IAM account is suspended and therefore, their access to all databases are automatically suspended. This method removes the possibility of unauthorized accounts being left on database servers after a user has left. For more information, see [IAM Database Passwords](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/usercredentials.htm#usercredentials_iam_db_pwd "Manage your IAM database passwords overview."). See the [Oracle Security Guide, Chapter 7 ](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/dbseg/authenticating-and-authorizing-iam-users-oracle-autonomous-databases.html)for information about how IAM users authenticate and authorize to OCI databases.
### IAM Database User Names ðŸ”— 
If your OCI IAM database username is longer than 128 bytes, you must set a different database username and a database password that is less than 128 bytes. IAM enforces the uniqueness of database usernames within a tenancy. The database user name is not case-sensitive and has the same allowable characters as an IAM user name (ASCII letters, numerals, hyphens, periods, underscores, +, and @)). This is more restrictive than local database usernames, which are governed by the character set of the database. See [Database Object Names and Qualifiers](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf/Database-Object-Names-and-Qualifiers.html) for more information. 
To create, change, and delete IAM database user names, see [Working with IAM Database User Names](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/usercredentials.htm#iam_database_user_names "You can manage your own IAM database user name with the Console, including creating, changing, and deleting it.").
### Alternate IAM Database User Names
You can create an alternate IAM database user name that contains only letters and numbers, does not include special characters, and can be shorter than regular IAM database user names. 
You can create an alternate IAM database user name:
  * If your user name is too long or hard to type
  * To make logging in easier with a user name that does not include special characters


### **IAM Database Password Specifications** ðŸ”— 
The IAM database password complexity uses almost the same rules supported in IAM for Console passwords (no double quotes ["] in IAM passwords). For details, see [Creating an IAM database password](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/usercredentials.htm#usercredentials_topic_creating_a_database_password "You can manage your own IAM database password with the Console, including creating, changing and deleting it.").
### **Failed Login Lockout** s ðŸ”— 
For information about failed logins, see [IAM Database Password Lockouts](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/usercredentials.htm#usercredentials_topic_password_lockouts "A user's account gets locked if the user encounters 10 consecutive failed sign-in attempts.").
### **Password Rollovers** ðŸ”— 
Applications have a password in a wallet or other secure mechanism and in the database. When changing a database password, you also need to change the password in the application wallet. You normally do this during application downtime. However, having a second password allows you to change passwords without application downtime. Since both passwords are usable, the application admin can swap passwords in the application wallet files at their convenience, and can remove the old password from IAM later. This is independent of the database gradual password rollover status in the database. The database still reflects open status, that is, not open and in rollover.
## Using the Console ðŸ”— 
[To change your Console password](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcredentials.htm)
You're prompted to change your initial one-time password _the first time_ you sign in to the Console. The following procedure is for changing your password again later. 
**Note**
For Federated Users
If your company uses an identity provider (other than Oracle Identity Cloud Service) to manage user logins and passwords, you can't use the Console to update your password. You do that with your identity provider.
  1. Sign in to the Console using the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure User Name and Password.
  2. After you sign in, select the **Profile** menu on the upper-right side of the navigation bar at the top of the page, and then select **Change password**.
  3. Enter the **Current Password**.
  4. Enter your new password in the **New Password** and **Confirm New Password** fields, and then select **Save New Password**.


[To create or reset another user's Console password](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcredentials.htm)
If you're an administrator, you can use the following procedure to create or reset a user's password. The procedure generates a new one-time password that the user must change the next time they sign in to the Console.
  1. View the user's details: Select the name of the identity domain that you want to work in. You might need to change the compartment to find the domain that you want. Then, select **Users**. Locate the user in the list, and then select the user's name to view the details.
  2. Select **Create/Reset Password**.
The new one-time password is displayed. If you're an administrator performing the task for another user, you need to securely deliver the new password to the user. The user will be prompted to change their password the next time they sign in to the Console. If they don't change it within 7 days, the password will expire and you'll need to create a new one-time password for the user.


[To reset your password if you forgot it](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcredentials.htm)
If you have an email address in your user profile, you can use the **Forgot Password** link on the sign on page to have a temporary password sent to you. If you don't have an email address in your user profile, you must ask an administrator to reset your password for you.
[To unblock a user](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcredentials.htm)
If you're an administrator, you can unblock a user who has tried 10 times in a row to sign in to the Console unsuccessfully. See [To unblock a user](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcredentials.htm#unblock_user).
[To add an API signing key](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcredentials.htm)
You can use the Console to generate the private/public key pair for you. If you already have a key pair, you can choose to upload the public key. When you use the Console to add the key pair, the Console also generates a configuration file preview snippet for you. 
The following procedures work for a regular user or an administrator. Administrators can manage API keys for either another user or themselves. 
**About the Config File Snippet**
When you use the Console to add the API signing key pair, a configuration file preview snippet is generated with the following information:
  * `user` - the OCID of the user for whom the key pair is being added.
  * `fingerprint` - the fingerprint of the key that was just added.
  * `tenancy` - your tenancy's OCID.
  * `region` - the currently selected region in the Console.
  * `key_file`- the path to your downloaded private key file. You must update this value to the path on your file system where you saved the private key file. 


If your config file already has a DEFAULT profile, you'll need to do one of the following:
  * Replace the existing profile and its contents.
  * Rename the existing profile.
  * Rename this profile to a different name after pasting it into the config file.


You can copy this snippet into your config file, to help you get started. If you don't already have a config file, see [SDK and CLI Configuration File](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm) for details on how to create one. You can also retrieve the config file snippet later for an API signing key whenever you need it. See: To get the config file snippet for an API signing key.
[To generate an API signing key pair](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcredentials.htm)
**Prerequisite:** Before you generate a key pair, create the `.oci` directory in your home directory to store the credentials. See [SDK and CLI Configuration File](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm) for more details.
  1. View the user's details:
     * If you're adding an API key for _yourself_ : In the navigation bar, select the **Profile** menu and then select **User settings** or **My profile** , depending on the option that you see.
     * If you're an administrator adding an API key for _another user_ : Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Users**. Locate the user in the list, and then click the user's name to view the details.
  2. Click **Add API Key**.
  3. In the dialog, select **Generate API Key Pair**.
  4. Click **Download Private Key** and save the key to your `.oci` directory. In most cases, you do not need to download the public key.
**Note** : If your browser downloads the private key to a different directory, be sure to move it to your `.oci` directory.
  5. Click **Add**. 
The key is added and the **Configuration File Preview** is displayed. The file snippet includes required parameters and values you'll need to create your configuration file. Copy and paste the configuration file snippet from the text box into your `~/.oci/config file`. (If you have not yet created this file, see [SDK and CLI Configuration File](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm) for details on how to create one.) 
After you paste the file contents, you'll need to update the `key_file` parameter to the location where you saved your private key file. 
If your config file already has a DEFAULT profile, you'll need to do one of the following:
     * Replace the existing profile and its contents.
     * Rename the existing profile.
     * Rename this profile to a different name after pasting it into the config file.
  6. Update the permissions on your downloaded private key file so that only you can view it:
    1. Go to the `.oci` directory where you placed the private key file.
    2. Use the command `chmod go-rwx                     ~/.oci/<oci_api_keyfile>.pem` to set the permissions on the file.


[To upload or paste an API key](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcredentials.htm)
**Prerequisite:** You have generated a public **RSA key in PEM format (minimum 2048 bits)**. The PEM format looks something like this:
Copy
```
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAoTFqF...
...
-----END PUBLIC KEYâ€”â€”
 OCI_PRIVATE_KEY
```

We recommend that you include a label at the end of the key. For example, `OCI_PRIVATE_KEY`.
  1. View the user's details:
     * If you're adding an API key for _yourself_ : In the navigation bar, select the **Profile** menu and then select **User settings** or **My profile** , depending on the option that you see.
     * If you're an administrator adding an API key for _another user_ : Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Users**. Locate the user in the list, and then click the user's name to view the details.
  2. Click **Add API Key**.
  3. In the dialog, select **Choose Public Key File** to upload your file, or **Paste Public Key** , if you prefer to paste it into a text box 
  4. Click **Add**.
The key is added and the **Configuration File Preview** is displayed. The file snippet includes required parameters and values you'll need to create your configuration file. Copy and paste the configuration file snippet from the text box into your `~/.oci/config file`. (If you have not yet created this file, see [SDK and CLI Configuration File](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm) for details on how to create one.) 
After you paste the file contents, you'll need to update the `key_file` parameter to the location where you saved your private key file. 
If your config file already has a DEFAULT profile, you'll need to do one of the following:
     * Replace the existing profile and its contents.
     * Rename the existing profile.
     * Rename this profile to a different name after pasting it into the config file.
