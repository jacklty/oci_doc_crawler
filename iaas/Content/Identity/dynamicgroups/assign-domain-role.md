# Assigning a Domain Role
By default, every dynamic group is associated with the Identity Cloud Service (IDCS) application. You can assign a domain role to that application to allow members of the dynamic group to perform certain actions with IDCS in the identity domain.
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Domains**.
  2. Select the identity domain you want to work in and select **Dynamic Groups**.
  3. Select the name of the dynamic group you want to update.
  4. Under **Resources** , select **Domain roles**.
  5. Under **Domain roles** , select the Actions menu (![Actions Menu](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/libraries/global-images/actions-menu.png)) for the IDCS application, and then select **Manage roles**.
  6. Select the checkbox for all the predefined domain roles that you want to assign to members of the dynamic group.
  7. When you are ready, select **Save changes**.
