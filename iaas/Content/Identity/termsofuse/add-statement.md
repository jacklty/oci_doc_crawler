# Adding a terms of use statement
The statement in a terms of use document provides the text that users must agree to when they first launch any apps assigned to the terms of use. If you want, you can multiple terms of use statements, for example, if you need them in different languages.
  1. In the **Add terms of use statements** screen, do the following:
     * **Language** : Select the language in which you want to create the statement for your terms of use.
     * **Statement** : Enter or paste the statement content.
To save changes, select **Add terms of use statement**.
  2. (Optional) If you want to create additional terms of use statements, perhaps in different languages, repeat the previous step.
