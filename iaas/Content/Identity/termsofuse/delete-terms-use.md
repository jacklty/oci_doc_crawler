# Deleting a Terms of Use
Delete a terms of use document for a domain.
Remove all application references to a terms of use before you delete the terms of use. Otherwise, the only way you can delete a terms of use is to force the deletion.
**Note** You cannot delete the default terms of use.
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Domains**.
  2. Click the name of the identity domain that you want to work in. You might need to change the compartment to find the domain that you want. On the domain details page, click **Security**.
  3. Select **Terms of use**.
  4. Select the terms of use to delete.
  5. Select the Actions menu (![Actions Menu](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/libraries/global-images/actions-menu.png)) then select **Delete terms of use document**.
  6. To confirm, select **Delete terms of use document**.
