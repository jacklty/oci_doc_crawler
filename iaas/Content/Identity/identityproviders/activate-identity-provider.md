# Activating or Deactivating an Identity Provider
Activate or deactivate an identity provider (IdP) for an identity domain in IAM.

  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Domains**.
  2. Click the name of the identity domain that you want to work in. You might need to change the compartment to find the domain that you want. Then, click **Security** and then **Identity providers**.
  3. Select the name of the IdP that you want to activate or deactivate.
  4. Depending on the action that you want to take, select **Activate IdP** or **Deactivate IdP**.
  5. Confirm the action.
