# Assigning Identity Providers to the Policy
You can assign identity providers to an IdP policy. These identity providers will appear in the **Sign In** page, and a user can use them to access resources that are protected by IAM, such as the **My profile** console or the IAM console.
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Domains**.
  2. Click the name of the identity domain that you want to work in. You might need to change the compartment to find the domain that you want. Under **Security** click **IdP policies**.
  3. Select the name of the IdP policy that you want to assign an IdP to.
  4. Under **Resources** , select **Identity provider rules**.
  5. Select the Actions menu (![Actions Menu](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/libraries/global-images/actions-menu.png)) for the rule to which you want to assign an identity provider, then select **Edit IdP rule**.
  6. Select the **Assign identity providers** box and select the identity provider that you want to assign to this rule.
Repeat this step to assign additional identity providers.
  7. When you are finished, select **Save changes**.
