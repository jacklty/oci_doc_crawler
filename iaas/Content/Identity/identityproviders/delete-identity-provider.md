# Deleting an Identity Provider
Delete an identity provider (IdP) for an identity domain in IAM.
Remove an IdP from all policies before deactivating or deleting an IdP.
**Note** Deleting a social IdP removes the user profiles that are linked to that IdP. Consider deactivating a social IdP (which doesn't remove the user profiles) rather than deleting it, so that users can still see the accounts in **My profile** but can't use them to sign in.
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Domains**.
  2. Click the name of the identity domain that you want to work in. You might need to change the compartment to find the domain that you want. Then, click **Security** and then **Identity providers**.
  3. Select the name of the IdP that you want to delete.
  4. Select **More actions** , and then select **Delete IdP**.
  5. To confirm the deletion, select **Delete IdP**.
