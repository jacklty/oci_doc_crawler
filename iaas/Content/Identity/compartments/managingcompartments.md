## Required IAM Policy ðŸ”— 
If you belong to the Administrators group or if an administrator has created a policy that allows you to manage compartments, then you have the required access for managing compartments. Policies that manage compartments can be scoped to the tenancy level or to the compartment level.
For an additional policy related to compartment management, see [Let a compartment admin manage the compartment](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/commonpolicies.htm#compartment-admin-manage-compartment).
If you're new to policies, see [IAM Policies Overview](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/policieshow/Policy_Basics.htm#top "IAM policies govern control of resources in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure \(OCI\) tenancies."). If you want to dig deeper into writing policies for compartments or other IAM components, see [Details for IAM without Identity Domains](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Reference/iampolicyreference.htm).
