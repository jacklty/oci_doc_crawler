# Creating an IAM database password
You can manage your own IAM database password with the Console, including creating, changing and deleting it.
Creating an IAM database password follows the same rules as creating an Console password except that the double quote character (") is not allowed in the IAM database password. See [About the Password Policy Rules](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingpasswordrules.htm) for the rules to create Console passwords.
To create your own IAM database password, see [To create an IAM Database Password](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcredentials.htm#to_create_an_iam_password "Use the Console to create a database password.").
