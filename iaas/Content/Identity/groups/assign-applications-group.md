# Assigning Applications to a Group
Assign applications to an identity domain group in IAM.
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Domains**.
  2. Click the name of the identity domain that you want to work in. You might need to change the compartment to find the domain that you want. Then, click **Groups**.
  3. To assign an application to all users, search for and select the **All Tenant Users** group.
To assign an application a group that contains a subset of users, select the name of the group, and then select **Applications**.
  4. Select **Assign applications**.
  5. In the **Assign applications** window, select each application that you want to assign to the group by selecting the Actions menu (![Actions Menu](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/libraries/global-images/actions-menu.png)) for the application, and then select **Assign**.
  6. Select **Close**.
