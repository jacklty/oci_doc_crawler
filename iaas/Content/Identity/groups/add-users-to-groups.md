# Adding Users to a Group
Add users to an identity domain group in IAM.
**Note** If you want to add a number of users in a group, you can import them from a csv file. See [Importing Groups](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/datatransfer/import-groups.htm#import-groups "Import groups using a comma-separated values \(CSV\) file.")
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Domains**.
  2. Click the name of the identity domain that you want to work in. You might need to change the compartment to find the domain that you want. Then, click **Groups**.
  3. Select the group you want add users to.
  4. Select **Assign user to groups**.
  5. To add users to the group, select the checkbox for each user that you want to add to the group.
**Tip** To search for a user, select the text box, enter all or part of the beginning of the username, first name, or last name of the user, and then press **Enter**.
  6. Select **Add**.
