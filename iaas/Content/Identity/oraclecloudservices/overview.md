# Managing Oracle Cloud Services
Learn about Software as a Service (SaaS), Data as a Service (DaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) services used in Oracle Cloud.
Oracle Cloud offers a host of cloud services for you to purchase.
**Note** When you purchase an Oracle Cloud Service, the service appears on the **Oracle Cloud Services** page in the Console.
Application services are classified into two categories:
  * Software as a Service (SaaS): Provides a software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted.
  * Data as a Service (DaaS): Provides data on demand to a user regardless of geographic or organizational separation of the provider and consumer.


Platform services are also classified into two categories:
  * Platform as a Service (PaaS): Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and deploying an application.
  * Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Provides access to computing resources (that is, virtualized hardware and computing infrastructure) in Oracle Cloud across a public connection.


For a comprehensive list of the available Oracle Cloud SaaS, DaaS, PaaS, and IaaS services, go to <https://www.oracle.com/cloud> and from the **Oracle Cloud** menu, select that category of services that interests you. From the page that opens, you can find links to detailed information about each service.
Oracle Cloud securely integrates its different cloud services, customer applications, and cloud services from other vendors. For example; this integration lets you,
  * Embed Oracle CX Sales within your own application running on Oracle Java Cloud Service - SaaS Extension.
  * Extend Oracle Fusion Customer Relationship Management Cloud Service with a custom application.
  * Tie together an Oracle Cloud service with functionality from other sites, such as Salesforce.
  * Use an Oracle Cloud service as the infrastructure for building your own applications.


You can perform the following tasks for Oracle Cloud Services: 
  * [Activating Oracle Cloud Services](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/oraclecloudservices/activating-oracle-cloud-services.htm#activating-oracle-cloud-services "The account administrator is responsible for activating an Oracle Cloud service.")
  * [Deactivating Oracle Cloud Services](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/oraclecloudservices/deactivating-oracle-cloud-services.htm#deactivating-oracle-cloud-services "When you buy an Oracle Cloud service, the service appears on the Oracle Cloud Services page in the Console where you can deactivate it.")
