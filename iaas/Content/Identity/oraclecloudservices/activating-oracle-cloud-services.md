# Activating Oracle Cloud Services
The account administrator is responsible for activating an Oracle Cloud service.
When you purchase an Oracle Cloud service, the service appears on the **Oracle Cloud Services** page in the Console where you can activate it.
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Domains**. Click the name of the identity domain that you want to work in. You might need to change the compartment to find the domain that you want. Then, click **Oracle Cloud Services**.
  2. Locate the Oracle Cloud Services that you want to activate and select the checkbox next to each.
**Note** For Oracle Cloud Services that can't be activated, the checkbox isn't selectable.
  3. Select **Activate**.
  4. Confirm the activation.
