# Deactivating Oracle Cloud Services
When you buy an Oracle Cloud service, the service appears on the **Oracle Cloud Services** page in the Console where you can deactivate it. 
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Domains**. Click the name of the identity domain that you want to work in. You might need to change the compartment to find the domain that you want. Then, click **Oracle Cloud Services**.
  2. Locate the Oracle Cloud Services that you want to deactivate and select the checkbox next to each.
**Note**
Some Oracle Cloud Services are required by Oracle and can't be deactivated. For Oracle Cloud Services that can't be deactivated, their checkbox isn't selectable.
  3. Select **Deactivate**.
  4. Confirm the deactivation.
