# Removing a Password Policy
Remove a password policy that you no longer need in an identity domain in IAM.
  1. On the **Password policy** list page, select the name of the policy you want to remove. If you need help finding the list page, see [Listing Password Policies](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/passwordpolicies/listing-password-policies.htm#untitled1 "Retrieve a list of password policies.").
  2. On the details page, select **Remove**.
  3. In the **Remove password policy** dialog box, select **Remove** to confirm the action.
The password policy is removed and no longer appears in the list.
