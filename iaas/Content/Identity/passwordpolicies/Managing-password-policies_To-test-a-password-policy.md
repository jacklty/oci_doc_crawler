# Testing a Password Policy
Test a password policy in an identity domain in IAM.
After you create a password policy, you can test the criteria for the policy to validate that the password policy has been set.
  1. On the **Password policy** list page, select the name of the policy you want to test. If you need help finding the list page, see [Listing Password Policies](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/passwordpolicies/listing-password-policies.htm#untitled1 "Retrieve a list of password policies.").
  2. On the details page, select **Test password policy**.
  3. In the **Test password** panel, select the box, and then enter a test password.
After you enter the first character, the gray question mark associated with each criterion turns into either a red X mark or a green check mark. As the password meets each criterion for the policy, the associated red X mark changes to a green check mark. After all criteria are met, all red X marks appear as green check marks. 
  4. When you're finished, select **Close**.
