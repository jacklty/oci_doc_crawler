# Viewing Provisioned Federated Users in the Console
View provisioned federated users in the Console.
After the prerequisites are satisfied, you can view users that you create in your IdP that belong to groups mapped to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure groups. Whenever you add a user to a group mapped to an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure group, the user automatically displays in the Console.
**To list users in the Console** :
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Domains**.
  2. Select the name of the identity domain that you want to work in. You might need to change the compartment to find the domain that you want. Then, select **Users**.
