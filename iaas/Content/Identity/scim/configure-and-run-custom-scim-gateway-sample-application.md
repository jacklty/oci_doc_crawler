# Configuring and Running the Custom SCIM Gateway Sample Application
Configure and run the custom SCIM gateway sample application in an OCI IAM identity domain to work with the **GenericScim - Basic** template.
  1. Edit the `run` script file in the `root` folder of the sample SCIM gateway application, update the `ADMINUSER` and `ADMINPASS` values, and then save the file.
If you're running the sample application in a UNIX or Mac environment, then use the `run.sh` script. If you're using Windows, then use `run.bat`.
  2. Open a command prompt or terminal, navigate to the `root` folder of the sample application, run the `run` script by typing the name of the file, and then press **Enter** to start the sample application. You see log information that will help you to understand what the sample application is doing.
Ensure the hostname of this sample application is reachable through the Internet so that IAM can contact the application.
