# Enabling and Configuring Connectivity for Provisioning for Your Application
Enable provisioning for your application and provide connectivity information for it. IAM uses this information to connect to your application's SCIM REST API endpoint for provisioning purposes.
  1. On the App Details page, select **Edit provisioning**.
  2. Turn on the **Enable provisioning** switch.
  3. In the **Confirmation** window, select **OK**.
  4. Use the information in steps 6 and 8 of [Adding an Application Using the Generic SCIM App Template](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/scim/add-application-using-generic-scim-app-template.htm#add-application-using-generic-scim-app-template "Add an application to an OCI IAM identity domain using the Generic SCIM App Template.") to populate the fields of the **Configure connectivity** section.
