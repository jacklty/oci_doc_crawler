# Overview of Self-Registration Profiles
Use self-registration profiles to create accounts in a verified or unverified state. Customize the self-registration process by specifying the user's email domains allowed when self-registering, and adding header, footer, success, and user consent text.
## Introduction
Using self-registration profiles, you can: 
  * Create a self-registration **consumer flow** that allows users to create an account in a verified state. Use the REST API to turn off the `activationEmailRequired` option. The user can then directly sign in using a username and password to authenticate. 
  * Create a self-registration **partner flow** that allows users to create an account in an unverified state. Use the REST API to turn on the `activationEmailRequired` option so that a user receives a link in the welcome email to verify the user. After the user clicks this link, the user's state is changed to verified and the user can sign in. 
  * Delete profiles using the user interface or the REST API.
  * Specify whether users are prompted and must accept a user consent before self-registering.
  * Assign groups to a profile so that users are assigned to all the groups that are part of that profile.
  * Specify the user's email domains allowed when accessing the self-registration process. Only users with access to these specific email domains are allowed to register.
  * Customize the self-registration login page with your header and footer logos.
  * Customize the header, footer, success, and user consent text.

## Required Policy or Role ðŸ”— 
To create self-registration profiles, you must have one of the following access grants:
  * Be a member of the Administrators group
  * Be granted the Identity Domain Administrator role
  * Be a member of a group granted `manage` domains
