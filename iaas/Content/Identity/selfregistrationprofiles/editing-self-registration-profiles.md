# Updating a Self-Registration Profile
Edit options in self-registration profiles in IAM. For example, you can assign the profile to new groups or change the allowed email domains.
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Domains**. 
  2. Select the name of the identity domain that you want to work in. You might need to change the compartment to find the domain that you want.
  3. On the domain details page, select **Settings**.
  4. On the **Settings** page, select **Self registration**.
  5. From the the Actions menu (![Actions Menu](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/libraries/global-images/actions-menu.png)) for the profile you want to edit, select **Edit**.
  6. On the **Edit self-registration profile** page, make the changes.
  7. Select **Save changes.**
