# Adding a User to a Group
Add a user in an OCI IAM identity domain to a group.
**Note** If you want to add a number of users in a group, you can import them from a csv file. See [Importing Groups](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/datatransfer/import-groups.htm#import-groups "Import groups using a comma-separated values \(CSV\) file.")
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Domains**.
  2. Select the name of the identity domain that you want to work in. You might need to change the compartment to find the domain that you want. Then, select **Users**.
  3. Select the user that you want to modify.
  4. Select **Groups**.
  5. Select **Assign user to groups**. To search for groups to assign to the user account, in the search field, enter all or part of the beginning of the group names or descriptions that you want to locate.
  6. In the **Assign user to groups** window, select the checkbox for each group that you want to assign to the user account.
  7. Select **Assign user**.
