# Editing a User
Modify the details of a user account in an OCI IAM identity domain.
You can change all the information associated with the user except the Username.
User information is grouped under the following headings:
  * User information
  * Identity provider information
    * **Federated** : Turn on this option when the user signs in to the OCI Console using a federated IdP.
    * **Authenticated By** : Choose the application that the user is authenticated to. By default, the "Oracle Identity Domain" application is seeded in each identity domain.
  * User preferences
  * Work information
  * Other information


  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Domains**.
  2. Select the name of the identity domain that you want to work in. You might need to change the compartment to find the domain that you want. Then, select **Users**.
  3. Select the user account that you want to modify.
  4. Select **Edit user**.
  5. Modify an attribute value for the user account.
  6. Select **Save changes**.
