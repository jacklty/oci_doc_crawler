# Deleting a User
Delete one or more user accounts in an OCI IAM identity domain for users who no longer need access to the service.
**Note** When you delete a user, the audit data of the user remains in the system. You can't delete your own user account.
You cannot delete a user who is the last administrator granted the identity domain administrator role. See [Removing an Identity Domain Administrator](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/securing/iam-identity-removeadmin.htm#iam-identity-removeadmin "Remove a user as an administrator in an identity domain in IAM.").
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Domains**.
  2. Select the name of the identity domain that you want to work in. You might need to change the compartment to find the domain that you want. Then, select **Users**.
  3. Select the checkbox next to each user account that you want to delete.
  4. Select **More actions** , and then select **Delete**.
  5. In the **Delete user** dialog box, select **Delete user**.
