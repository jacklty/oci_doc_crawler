# Changing a User's Status
Activate or deactivate a user account in an OCI IAM identity domain.
You can activate or deactivate a user account from the Console.
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Domains**.
  2. Select the name of the identity domain that you want to work in. You might need to change the compartment to find the domain that you want. Then, select **Users**.
  3. Select the checkbox for the user account that you want to activate or deactivate.
  4. Select the Actions menu (![Actions Menu](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/libraries/global-images/actions-menu.png)), then select **Activate** or **Deactivate**.
**Note** If an administrator or user is signed in to an active session when they're deactivated, they will still have access to the session, but with limited capabilities. After they're signed out of an active session, they won't be able to sign back in.
