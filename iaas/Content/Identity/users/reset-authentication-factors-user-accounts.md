# Resetting Authentication Factors for User Accounts
Describes how to reset all verification factors for a user in an OCI IAM identity domain if the user's device can't be used to provide a second factor for authentication, for example, if the user's device is lost or the Oracle Mobile Authenticator app has been deleted from the device.
Resetting all verification factors removes any existing factors in which the user is enrolled. The next time the user signs in, the user is prompted to enroll in 2â€“step verification and account recovery.
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Domains**.
  2. Select the name of the identity domain that you want to work in. You might need to change the compartment to find the domain that you want. Then, select **Users**.
  3. Select the user account for which you want to reset authentication factors.
  4. Select **Reset factors**.
  5. In the **Reset factors** window, select **Reset factors**.
