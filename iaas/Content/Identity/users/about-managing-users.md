## Required Policy or Role ðŸ”— 
To manage identity domain settings, you must have one of the following access grants:
  * Be a member of the Administrators group
  * Be granted the Identity Domain Administrator role or the Security Administrator role
  * Be a member of a group granted `manage` domains


To give this permission to non administrators, you'll need to additionally write policies like the following:
Copy
```
allow group GroupA to {USAGE_BUDGET_READ} in tenancy
allow group GroupA to {USAGE_BUDGET_INSPECT} in tenancy
allow group GroupA to {USAGE_BUDGET_MANAGE} in tenancy
allow group GroupA to {TENANCY_INSPECT} in tenancy
```

where you replace GroupA with the name of the group you want to grant the permission to.
To understand more about policies and roles, see [The Administrators Group, Policy, and Administrator Roles](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/getstarted/identity-domains.htm#The), [Understanding Administrator Roles](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/roles/understand-administrator-roles.htm#understand-administrator-roles "Learn about administrator roles and the privileges associated with each role so that you can delegate administrative tasks to other users, as needed."), and [IAM Policies Overview](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/policieshow/Policy_Basics.htm#top "IAM policies govern control of resources in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure \(OCI\) tenancies.").
