# Adding Tags to an Application
You're an identity domain administrator or application administrator who wants to create custom attributes for your applications that can be used to search for the applications more effectively. To do this, you add tags to your applications. Tags are key-value pairs that are used to organize and identify applications.
For example, suppose you're creating three versions of an application: one for development purposes, one for testing purposes, and one that will be used in production. You can create the following tags for these versions: **Version: Development** ; **Version: Testing** ; and **Version: Production**.
You can create new tags for your confidential, mobile, SAML, enterprise, and app catalog applications using the Tags tab in the **Details** pane. You can use these tags to identify and organize your applications.
**Note** You can delete tags by selecting the **X** icon next to the tag. However, some tags are protected and can't be deleted.
  1. In the **Tags** area of the **Details** pane, select **Add Tags**.
  2. Choose a **Tag Namespace** or leave the namespace as **None** to add a free-form tag. See [Tags and Tag Namespace Concepts](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Tagging/Tasks/managingtagsandtagnamespaces.htm).
  3. In the **Tag Key** and **Tag Value** fields of the **Add Tags** window, enter or select the key-value pair for the tag you're creating.
  4. (Optional) To create more tags, select **+Another Tag** , and repeat the process.
  5. Select **Add Tags**.
