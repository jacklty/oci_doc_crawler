# Assigning an Existing User
You can assign an existing user to the imported user account in the **Import** tab if the user is present in IAM and the import failed to match the user.
  1. On the row of the imported user, select **Assign existing user** from the **Actions** menu.
  2. In the **Assign user** window, search for an existing user, select the required user and select **Assign**.

The user account is manually linked to the existing user and the synchronization status is confirmed.
