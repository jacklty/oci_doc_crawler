# Assigning Applications to a User Using Account Form
Account Form will be visible in the user interface with account attributes for a provisioning application if the underlying App Template supports it. With Account Form, when you grant a provisioning application to a user, you can provide account values and when you edit a provisioned account, you can update existing account values.
To provide specific values using account form:
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Domains**. 
  2. Click the name of the identity domain that you want to work in. You might need to change the compartment to find the domain that you want. Then, click **Integrated applications**. 
  3. Select the application that you want to change.
  4. Under **Resources** , select **User** and select **Assign users**.
  5. In the Assign users window, for the user who needs access to the application, select **Assign** from the **Actions** menu for that user.
  6. Select **Next**.
  7. (Optional) Add a path.
  8. Select **Assign user**. The user account is assigned.
  9. Select the next user you want to provide access to this application and repeat the steps 1 through 7.
