# Synchronizing Imported User Accounts
After you import the users, if a matching user account doesn't exist in the identity domain, you can either assign the user account to an existing user or create a new user for the user account.
If the imported user account exists, an exact match is found and no further action is required. The synchronization status of the user account is set as confirmed.
