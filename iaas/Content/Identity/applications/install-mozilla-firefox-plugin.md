# Installing the Mozilla Firefox Plugin
If you are using Mozilla Firefox and you need to install the plugin, instead of downloading the Secure Form Fill Mozilla Firefox plug-in from the Mozilla Store, install the Secure Form Fill Mozilla Firefox plug-in from the My Apps page. You will be prompted to download the plug-in from the My Apps page the first time that you access to a secure form fill app.
