# Deleting Applications
Delete applications from an identity domain in IAM.
Before you deactivate an application, you must deactivate it. See [Deactivating Applications](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/applications/deactivate-applications.htm#deactivate-applications "Deactivating an application temporarily disables the access rights to applications that users or groups have.").
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Domains**. 
  2. Click the name of the identity domain that you want to work in. You might need to change the compartment to find the domain that you want. Then, click **Integrated applications**. 
  3. Select the checkbox for each application that you want to delete, or to delete all applications, select the checkbox in the heading row of the table.
  4. In the conformation dialog box, select **Delete application**.
You can't delete Oracle Public Cloud application from the UI. If you try to delete an Oracle Public Cloud application, you receive an error message.
