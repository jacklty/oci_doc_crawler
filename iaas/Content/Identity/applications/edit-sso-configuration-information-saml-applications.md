# Editing SSO Configuration Information for SAML Applications
You can edit SSO configuration information for SAML applications. 
See [Add a SAML Application](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/applications/add-saml-application.htm#add-saml-application "Create a Security Assertion Markup Language \(SAML\) application and grant it to users so that your users can single sign-on \(SSO\) into your SaaS applications that support SAML for SSO.") for more information about the SSO configuration settings for SAML applications.
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Domains**. 
  2. Click the name of the identity domain that you want to work in. You might need to change the compartment to find the domain that you want. Then, click **Integrated applications**.
  3. Select the SAML application from the list of applications listed.
  4. Under the **SSO configuration** section, select **Edit SSO configuration**.
  5. In the **General** section, modify required SAML assertion attributes for the SAML application.
  6. In the **Additional configurations** section, modify optional advanced SAML assertion settings for the SAML application (for example, selecting **Assertion** from the **Signed SSO** list to indicate that you want the SAML assertion signed).
  7. In the **Attribute configuration** section, modify user-specific and group-specific attributes for the SAML application (for example, selecting the type of user attribute from the **User attribute** list or selecting the condition by which you want to filter the group memberships from the **Condition** list).
  8. Select **Save changes**.
