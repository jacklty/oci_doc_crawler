# Managing Applications
Identity domains provide a secure and centralized cloud service to manage your cloud, Oracle, custom, and enterprise applications.
You can do the following tasks with applications:
  * [Adding Applications](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/applications/add-applications.htm#add-applications "You can add Custom Applications, if you're assigned to either the identity domain administrator role or the application administrator role.")
  * [Editing an Application](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/applications/modify-applications.htm#modify-applications "Change Oracle and custom applications in an identity domain in IAM. Assign users and groups, edit high-level information, import users and groups into the applications, export users and groups from applications, and perform specific configuration tasks for custom applications.")
  * [Activating an Application](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/applications/activate-applications.htm#activate-applications "Activate an application in an identity domain in IAM to reinstate the access rights to the application for users and groups.")
  * [Deactivating Applications](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/applications/deactivate-applications.htm#deactivate-applications "Deactivating an application temporarily disables the access rights to applications that users or groups have.")
  * [Deleting Applications](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/applications/remove-applications.htm#remove-applications "Delete applications from an identity domain in IAM.")
  * [Modifying Oracle Applications](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/applications/modify-oracle-applications.htm#modify-oracle-applications "You can assign and remove users and groups to Oracle Applications, and import and export users and groups for Oracle Application Roles. You can view the high-level information but can't edit any of the values in Oracle Applications.")
  * [Modifying Custom Applications](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/applications/modify-custom-applications.htm#modify-custom-applications "You can assign and remove users and edit high-level information in custom applications.")


## Required Policy or Role ðŸ”— 
To manage applications, you must have one of the following access grants:
  * Be a member of the Administrators group
  * Be granted the Identity Domain Administrator role or the Application Administrator role
  * Be a member of a group granted `manage` domains


To understand more about policies and roles, see [The Administrators Group, Policy, and Administrator Roles](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/getstarted/identity-domains.htm#The), [Understanding Administrator Roles](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/roles/understand-administrator-roles.htm#understand-administrator-roles "Learn about administrator roles and the privileges associated with each role so that you can delegate administrative tasks to other users, as needed."), and [IAM Policies Overview](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/policieshow/Policy_Basics.htm#top "IAM policies govern control of resources in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure \(OCI\) tenancies.").
