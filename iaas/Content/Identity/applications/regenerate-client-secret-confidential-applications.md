# Regenerating a Client Secret for Confidential Applications
When you create a confidential application, you use a Client ID and a Client Secret as part of your connection settings. You can regenerate your Client Secret at any time for a confidential application using the identity domains console.
**Before You Begin:**
Create an confidential application and activate it. See [Adding a Confidential Application](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/applications/add-confidential-application.htm#add-confidential-application "Confidential applications run on a protected server.").
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Domains**. 
  2. Click the name of the identity domain that you want to work in. You might need to change the compartment to find the domain that you want. Then, click **Integrated applications**. 
  3. Select the confidential application for which you want to regenerate a Client Secret.
  4. In the **General information** section, select **Regenerate**. The new Client Secret appears in the **New client secret** dialog box. Copy the Client Secret if necessary.
  5. Select **Close**.
