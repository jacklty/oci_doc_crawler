# Adding Apps to the Policy
You can assign apps to an identity provider policy. When a user attempts to authenticate through the apps, the only identity providers in the **Sign In** page are the ones you assigned to the policy. (You can assign only one identity provider policy to an app. If the app isn't assigned to any identity provider policy explicitly, then the default identity provider policy applies to the app.)
  1. Select **Apps**.
  2. Select **Add app**.
  3. In the **Add app** window, select the checkbox for each app that you want to add to the policy. Then, select **Add app**.
