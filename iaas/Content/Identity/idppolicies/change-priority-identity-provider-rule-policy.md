# Changing the Priority of an Identity Provider Rule for a Policy
You can change the priority of an identity provider rule for an identity provider policy to change the order that the identity domain evaluates it.
  1. Select **Identity provider rules**.
  2. Select **Edit priority**
  3. In the **Priority** column, select the up or down arrow next to the rule that you want to move. Set the rule at the position in the list that indicates the order in which you want it evaluated relative to the other rules.
For example, if the identity provider rule has a priority of 4, and you want it to be evaluated first, select the up arrow until it is at the top of the list. This rule is now evaluated first, and the rule previously on top will now have a priority of 2.
  4. When you are finished, select **Save changes**.
