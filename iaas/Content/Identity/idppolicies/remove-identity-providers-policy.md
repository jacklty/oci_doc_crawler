# Removing Identity Providers from the Policy
You can remove identity providers from an identity provider policy. These identity providers will no longer appear in the **Sign In** page, and a user can't use them to access resources protected by the identity domain.
  1. Select **Identity provider rules**.
  2. Select the Actions menu (![Actions Menu](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/libraries/global-images/actions-menu.png)) or the rule from which you want to remove an identity provider, and then select **Edit IdP rule**.
  3. In the **Assign identity providers** box, select the "X" in the label for each identity provider that you want to remove from this rule.
  4. When you are finished, select **Save changes**.
