# Adding Identity Providers to the Policy
You can add identity providers to an identity provider policy. These identity providers appear in the **Sign In** page, and a user can use them to access resources that are protected by the identity domain.
  1. Select **Identity provider rules**.
  2. Select the Actions menu (![Actions Menu](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/libraries/global-images/actions-menu.png)) for the rule to which you want to assign an identity provider, then select **Edit IdP rule**.
  3. Select the **Assign identity providers** box and select the identity provider that you want to assign to this rule.
Repeat this step to assign additional identity providers.
  4. When you are finished, select **Save changes**.
