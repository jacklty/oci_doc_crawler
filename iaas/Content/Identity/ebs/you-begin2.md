You must ensure you have configured the E-Business Suite mobile application to work with your Oracle E-Business Suite.
  * For Oracle E-Business Suite version 12.1.3 and version 12.2, apply or validate if mobile application patches have been applied as described in the Oracle E-Business Suite documentation. If you use Oracle E-Business Suite 12.2.8, you can skip applying the patches as those are already included.
  * To run the following configurations, you need to sign in to Oracle E-Business Suite with any user (excluding sysadmin) assigned to **Mobile Applications Manager** role.


You don't need to configure Oracle E-Business Suite with Oracle Access Manager (OAM) Access Gate. **E-Business Suite Asserter** replaces OAM Access Gate as the authentication mechanism for your Oracle E-Business Suite.
