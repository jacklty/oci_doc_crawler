# Set up E-Business Suite Mobile Applications
You can authenticate Oracle E-Business Suite mobile applications such as **Approvals for EBS** with IAM, when your Oracle E-Business Suite is using IAM E-Business Suite Asserter.
By doing so, when users open the mobile application and try to access Oracle E-Business Suite information, the asserter uses IAM to authenticate these users through the mobile application.
This set up is valid for the following Oracle E-Business Suite mobile applications:
  * Custom mobile applications based on **Oracle Mobile Application Framework** (Oracle MAF).
  * **Approvals for EBS** from **Oracle America, Inc**.


  * [Before You Begin](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/ebs/you-begin2.htm#you-begin2 "You must ensure you have configured the E-Business Suite mobile application to work with your Oracle E-Business Suite.")
