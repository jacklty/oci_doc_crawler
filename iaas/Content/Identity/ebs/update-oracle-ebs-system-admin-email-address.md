Update the email address of the `SYSADMIN` user in Oracle E-Business Suite to match the email address you provided to the corresponding user in IAM.
  1. Sign in as administrator (for example, `sysadmin`) to the Oracle E-Business Suite application.
  2. In the **Oracle E-Business Suite Home** page, scroll down to the **Navigator** , expand **User Management** , and then select **Users**.
  3. In the **User Maintenance** page, search for the **Username** `SYSADMIN`, and select the update icon for the `SYSADMIN` user.
  4. If the **Email** field hasn't been set, update this field value with the same email address you provided during the creation of the system administrator user in IAM, and then select **Apply**.
  5. Close Oracle E-Business Suite application.
