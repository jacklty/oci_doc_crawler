# What do You Need to Use the E-Business Suite Asserter
Verify which services, roles, components, and information are required to perform the configurations to integrate your Oracle E-Business Suite environment with IAM using the Identity Cloud Service E-Business Asserter.
## Before You Begin ðŸ”— 
Before you begin using E-Business Suite Asserter, understand how to enable it, and how it works with other components.
  * If your Oracle E-Business Suite is integrated with Oracle Access Manager, Oracle Internet Directory, E-Business Suite AccessGate, or uses any other SSO profile, then remove the integration between these components and Oracle E-Business Suite, and then restart the servers before using the IAM E-Business Suite Asserter.
  * Know what's supported. All Oracle E-Business modules which use browser-based login works with E-Business Suite Asserter for SSO. Excel-based login of Web ADI is supported. Mobile Apps for EBS, such as approvals and expenses, are supported. Modules which do not use browser-based login, such as Mobile Web Applications (MWA) and E-Signature, are not supported.

## Downloading the E-Business Suite Asserter from the IAM Console ðŸ”— 
Access the Downloads page from the IAM Console. From this page, you can download the IAM E-Business Suite Asserter.
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Domains**.
  2. Click the name of the identity domain that you want to work in. You might need to change the compartment to find the domain that you want. Then, click **Settings** and then **Downloads**.
  3. On the **Downloads** page, select the **Identity Cloud Service Asserter for E-Business Suite** download button.
For instances of Identity Cloud Service EBS Asserter Release 20.1.3, the feature for EBS Asserter has to be enabled.
     * If the EBS Asserter is disabled and you try to use it you see an error message.
     * Check the feature state by going to `_tenant base url_/admin/v1/FeatureInfos`.`oracle.idaas.ebs.asserter` should be marked as enabled.
  4. Save the `.zip` file to a temporary folder on your local machine (for example, `c:\temp` for Windows or `/temp` for UNIX).
  5. Extract the contents of the `.zip` file and find the location of the `ebs.war` and `idcs-wallet-<version>.jar` files.
The name of the files might vary accordingly to the version.
  6. Copy the `ebs.war` and `idcs-wallet-<version>.jar` files to a working folder into the E-Business Suite Asserter's WebLogic Server machine. For example, `/opt/ebssdk` (create this folder if it doesn't exist).
