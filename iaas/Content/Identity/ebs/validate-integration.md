# Validate the Integration
To successfully test SSO with Oracle E-Business Suite, ensure that you create a user in IAM whose username is identical to an Oracle E-Business Suite user name. Then, assign the E-Business Suite Asserter application to this user. These sample configurations and testing apply to an Oracle E-Business Suite demo distribution (VISION) environment. Check the values of the encoded URLs before applying them to your environment.
