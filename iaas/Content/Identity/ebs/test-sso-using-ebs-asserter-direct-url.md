# Testing the SSO Using the E-Business Suite Asserter Direct URL
You can use the E-Business Suite Asserter direct URL to verify the integration and ensure that the SSO works.
  1. Open a browser and enter the URL `https://ebsasserter.example.com:7002/ebs` for the E-Business Suite Asserter.
  2. The IAM **Sign In** page appears. Use the username and password of the previously created user to sign in.
  3. Upon successful authentication, the user is redirected to the Oracle E-Business Suite home page without having to enter Oracle E-Business Suite credentials.
  4. If the Oracle E-Business Suite home page appears, verify the logged-in username.
  5. Log out from Oracle E-Business Suite. The browser is redirected to the IAM **Sign In** page.
