# Testing the SSO Using the E-Business Suite Asserter Icon in IAM
You can use the E-Business Suite Asserter icon within the **My Apps** page in IAM to verify the integration and ensure that the SSO works.
  1. Open a browser and enter the IAM **My Console** URL: `https://idcs-example.identity.oraclecloud.com/ui/v1/myconsole`.
  2. Sign in using the credentials of the previously created user.
  3. In the **My Apps** page, select the E-Business Suite Asserter icon to access the **Oracle E-Business Suite Home** page.
  4. If the **Oracle E-Business Suite Home** page appears, verify the logged-in user name.
  5. Log out from Oracle E-Business Suite. The browser is redirected to the IAM **Sign In** page.
