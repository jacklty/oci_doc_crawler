# Using the E-Business Suite Asserter with IAM
Use the OCI IAM E-Business Suite Asserter component, which you can download from the Console, to integrate your Oracle E-Business Suite environment with other cloud and non cloud services using IAM Single Sign-On (SSO).
The IAM E-Business Suite Asserter is a lightweight Java application which helps to simplify the deployment topology for Oracle E-Business Suite single sign-on (SSO) by replacing Oracle Access Manager and Oracle Internet Directory with IAM.
To enhance security for the sign-in process, you can set up sign-on and identity provider policies, and configure multifactor authentication. You can also enable adaptive security to provide strong authentication capabilities and risk analysis for your users across applications and Oracle E-Business Suite in IAM.
You can use the asserter when you want to:
  * Have your Oracle E-Business Suite integrated with other applications for single sign-on.
  * Enhance security to access your Oracle E-Business Suite by enabling IAM security features such as multifactor authentication, sign-on policies, account recovery, and adaptive security.


The E-Business Suite Asserter:
  * Has multiple access modes for SSO with Oracle E-Business Suite. You can access Oracle E-Business Suite by using one of the following modes:
    * The asserter direct URL (which you can bookmark).
    * The IAM **My Apps** page.
    * The asserter direct URL with a redirect parameter.
    * Previously bookmarked Oracle E-Business Suite URLs.
  * Supports log out from multiple points including Oracle E-Business Suite, E-Business Suite Asserter, and IAM.
  * Allows single sign-on between Oracle E-Business Suite and Oracle E-Business Suite mobile application.
