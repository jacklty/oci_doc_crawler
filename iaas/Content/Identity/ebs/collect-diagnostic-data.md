# Collect Diagnostic Data
Configuration and log files help you diagnose issues relating to the IAM and Oracle E-Business Suite integration using the E-Business Suite Asserter.
Collect the following files:
  * The E-Business Suite Asserter configuration file (`bridge.properties`).
  * The E-Business Suite Asserter diagnostic logs.
  * The domain log file for the WebLogic domain where the E-Business Suite Asserter is deployed.
  * The HTTP header trace.
  * The output of validating the service. See [Validating the Service](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/ebs/validate-service.htm#validate-service "You can validate the Asserter configuration, E-Business Suite configuration, and IAM Application setup using the Validation Service.").


  * [Enabling the E-Business Suite Asserter Debug Log](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/ebs/enable-e-business-suite-asserter-debug-log.htm#enable-e-business-suite-asserter-debug-log "To send logs to a file, add FileHandler to the handlers property in the logger.properties file. This enables file logging globally.")
  * [Using Fiddler to Capture HTTP Traffic](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/ebs/use-fiddler-capture-traffic.htm#use-fiddler-capture-http-traffic "You can use Fiddler to view and debug HTTP traffic between a client and a host computer.")
