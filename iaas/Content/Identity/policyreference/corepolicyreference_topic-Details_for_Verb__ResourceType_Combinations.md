# Details for Verb + Resource-Type Combinations
Core services details for verb and resource type combinations.
The following tables show the [permissions](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/policies/permissions.htm) and API operations covered by each verb. The level of access is cumulative as you go from `inspect` > `read` > `use` > `manage`. For example, a group that can use a resource can also inspect and read that resource. A plus sign (+) in a table cell indicates incremental access compared to the cell directly above it, whereas "no extra" indicates no incremental access. 
For example, the `read` and `use` verbs for the `vcns` resource-type cover no extra permissions or API operations compared to the `inspect` verb. However, the `manage` verb includes several extra permissions and API operations.
## For virtual-network-family Resource Types ðŸ”— 
The following tables list the permissions and API operations covered by each of the individual resource-types included in `virtual-network-family`.
[vcns](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/policyreference/corepolicyreference_topic-Details_for_Verb__ResourceType_Combinations.htm)

## For instance-family Resource Types ðŸ”— 
The `instance-family` aggregate resource-type includes extra permissions beyond the sum of the permissions for the individual resource-types included in `instance-family`. For example: It includes a few permissions for `vnics` and `volumes`, even though those resource-types aren't generally considered part of the `instance-family`. Why are there extras included? So you can write fewer policy statements to cover general use cases, like working with an instance that has an attached block volume. You can write one statement for `instance-family` instead of multiple statements covering `instances`, `vnics`, and `volumes`. 
Here's a list of the extra permissions:
For `inspect instance-family`:
  * VNIC_READ
  * VNIC_ATTACHMENT_READ
  * VOLUME_ATTACHMENT_INSPECT


For `read instance-family`:
  * VOLUME_ATTACHMENT_READ


For `use instance-family`:
  * VNIC_ATTACH
  * VNIC_DETACH
  * VOLUME_ATTACHMENT_UPDATE


For `manage instance-family`:
  * VOLUME_ATTACHMENT_CREATE
  * VOLUME_ATTACHMENT_DELETE


The following tables list the permissions and API operations covered by each of the individual resource-types included in `instance-family`.
