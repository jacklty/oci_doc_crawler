# Details for License Manager
This topic covers details for writing policies to control access to the License Manager.
## Resource-Types ðŸ”— 
**Individual Resource-Types**
  * `licensemanager-record`
  * `licensemanager-settings`


## Supported Variables ðŸ”— 
License Manager supports all the general variables (see [General Variables for All Requests](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/policyreference/policyreference_topic-General_Variables_for_All_Requests.htm "Use the following general variables for all requests")), plus additional ones listed here:
**Required variables** (supplied by service for every request):
Variable | Variable Type | Comments  
---|---|---  
`target.resource.kind` | String | The resource kind name of the primary resource for the request.  
**Automatic Variables** (supplied by the SDK for every request):
Variable | Variable Type | Comments  
---|---|---  
`target.tenant.id` | Entity (OCID) | The OCID of the target tenant ID.  
## Details for Verb + Resource-Type Combinations ðŸ”— 
The following tables show the [permissions](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/policies/permissions.htm) and API operations covered by each verb. The level of access is cumulative as you go from `inspect` > `read` > `use` > `manage`. For example, a group that can use a resource can also inspect and read that resource. A plus sign (+) in a table cell indicates incremental access compared to the cell directly above it, whereas "no extra" indicates no incremental access.
