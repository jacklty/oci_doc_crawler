# Details for Subscriptions, Invoices, and Payment History
This topic covers details for writing policies to control access to the **Subscriptions** , **Invoices** , and **Payment History** pages in Billing and Cost Management.
## Resource-Types ðŸ”— 
  * `billing-schedules`
  * `computed-usages`
  * `invoices`
  * `invoice-preferences`
  * `subscription`
  * `subscribed-services`
  * `rate-cards`


## Supported Variables ðŸ”— 
Subscriptions, Invoices, and Payment History support all the general variables (see [General Variables for All Requests](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/policyreference/policyreference_topic-General_Variables_for_All_Requests.htm "Use the following general variables for all requests")), plus additional ones listed here:
**Required variables** (supplied by service for every request):
Variable | Variable Type | Comments  
---|---|---  
`target.resource.kind` | String | The resource kind name of the primary resource for the request.  
**Automatic Variables** (supplied by the SDK for every request):
Variable | Variable Type | Comments  
---|---|---  
`target.tenant.id` | Entity (OCID) | The OCID of the target tenant ID.  
## Details for Verb + Resource-Type Combinations ðŸ”— 
The following tables show the [permissions](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/policies/permissions.htm) and API operations covered by each verb. The level of access is cumulative as you go from `inspect` > `read` > `use` > `manage`. For example, a group that can use a resource can also inspect and read that resource. A plus sign (+) in a table cell indicates incremental access compared to the cell directly above it, whereas "no extra" indicates no incremental access.
