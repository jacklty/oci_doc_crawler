# Details for Connector Hub
Review details for writing policies to control access to the Connector Hub service.
## Individual Resource-Types ðŸ”— 
`serviceconnectors`
## Supported Variables ðŸ”— 
Connector Hub supports all the general variables (see [General Variables for All Requests](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/policyreference/policyreference_topic-General_Variables_for_All_Requests.htm "Use the following general variables for all requests")), plus the ones listed here.
The `serviceconnectors` resource type can use the following variables. 
Variable | Variable Type | Comments  
---|---|---  
`target.serviceconnector.id` | OCID |  Use this variable to control access for connectors.  
## Details for Verb + Resource-Type Combinations ðŸ”— 
The following tables show the [permissions](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/policies/permissions.htm) and API operations covered by each verb. The level of access is cumulative as you go from `inspect` > `read` > `use` > `manage`. For example, a group that can use a resource can also inspect and read that resource. A plus sign (+) in a table cell indicates incremental access compared to the cell directly above it, whereas "no extra" indicates no incremental access.
