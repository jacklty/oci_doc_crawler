# Details for API Gateway
This topic covers details for writing policies to control access to API Gateway.
## Resource-Types ðŸ”— 
### Aggregate Resource-Type
`api-gateway-family`
### Individual Resource-Types
  * `api-gateways`
  * `api-deployments`
  * `api-definitions`
  * `api-workrequests`
  * `api-certificates`
  * `api-sdks`
  * `api-subscribers`
  * `api-usage-plans`


### Comments
A policy that uses `<verb> api-gateway-family` is equivalent to writing one with a separate `<verb> <individual resource-type>` statement for each of the individual resource-types.
See the table in [Details for Verb + Resource-Type Combinations](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/policyreference/apigatewaypolicyreference.htm#apigatewayverbresourcetypecombination) for details of the API operations covered by each verb, for each individual resource-type included in `api-gateway-family`.
## Supported Variables ðŸ”— 
API Gateway supports all the general variables (see [General Variables for All Requests](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/policyreference/policyreference_topic-General_Variables_for_All_Requests.htm "Use the following general variables for all requests")).
## Details for Verb + Resource-Type Combinations ðŸ”— 
The following tables show the [permissions](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/policies/permissions.htm) and API operations covered by each verb. The level of access is cumulative as you go from `inspect` > `read` > `use` > `manage`. For example, a group that can use a resource can also inspect and read that resource. A plus sign (+) in a table cell indicates incremental access compared to the cell directly above it, whereas "no extra" indicates no incremental access. 
For example, the `read` verb for the `api-gateways` resource-type includes the same permissions and API operations as the `inspect` verb, plus the API_GATEWAY_READ permission and a number of API operations (e.g., `GetGateway`, etc.). The `use` verb covers additional permissions and API operations compared to `read`. Lastly, `manage` covers more permissions and operations compared to `use`.
