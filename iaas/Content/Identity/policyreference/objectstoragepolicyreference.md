# Details for Object Storage and Archive Storage
This topic covers details for writing policies to control access to Archive Storage and Object Storage.
**Tip** The object lifecycle policies feature requires that you grant permissions to the Object Storage service to archive and delete objects on your behalf. See [Using Object Lifecycle Policies](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/usinglifecyclepolicies.htm#permissions) for more information.
## Resource-Types ðŸ”— 
### Individual Resource-Types
`objectstorage-namespaces`
`buckets`
`objects`
### Aggregate Resource-Type
`object-family`
A policy that uses `<verb> object-family` is equivalent to writing one with a separate `<verb> <individual resource-type>` statement for each of the individual resource-types.
See the table in [Details for Verb + Resource-Type Combinations](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/policyreference/objectstoragepolicyreference.htm#Details) for details of the API operations covered by each verb, for each individual resource-type included in `object-family`.
## Supported Variables ðŸ”— 
Object Storage supports all the general variables (see [General Variables for All Requests](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/policyreference/policyreference_topic-General_Variables_for_All_Requests.htm "Use the following general variables for all requests")), plus the ones listed here:
Operations for This Resource-Type... | Can Use This Variable | Variable Type | Comments  
---|---|---|---  
`buckets` and `objects` | `target.bucket.name` | String | Use this variable to control access to a specific bucket. For an example policy, see [Let users write objects to Object Storage buckets](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/policiescommon/commonpolicies.htm#write-objects-to-buckets). **Important:** Condition matching is case insensitive. If you have a bucket named "BucketA" and a bucket named "bucketA", the condition `where target.bucket.name="BucketA"` applies to both. To avoid potential issues with resource names in policy, give your resources distinct names.  
`buckets` and `objects` | `target.bucket.tag.<TagNamespace>.<TagKeyDefinition>` | String | Use this variable to control access to the buckets that have the specific tag. See [Let users write objects to Object Storage buckets](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/policiescommon/commonpolicies.htm#write-objects-to-buckets).**Important:** You cannot use this variable for `CreateBucket` operations and operations that involve multiple buckets such as `ListBucket`.  
**Note** The `request.ipv4.ipaddress` and the `request.vcn.id` variables are deprecated. Instead of using these variables, create a network source to specify either an IP address range or a specific VCN ID. You can then use the network source in your policy to restrict access to only requests coming from the allowed networks. For more information, see [Overview of Network Sources](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/networksources/managingnetworksources.htm#Managing_Network_Sources).
## Details for Verb + Resource-Type Combinations ðŸ”— 
The following tables show the [permissions](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/policies/permissions.htm) and API operations covered by each verb. The level of access is cumulative as you go from `inspect` > `read` > `use` > `manage`. For example, a group that can use a resource can also inspect and read that resource. A plus sign (+) in a table cell indicates incremental access compared to the cell directly above it, whereas "no extra" indicates no incremental access. 
### For object-family Resource Types
[objectstorage-namespaces](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/policyreference/objectstoragepolicyreference.htm)
Verbs | Permissions | APIs Fully Covered | APIs Partially Covered  
---|---|---|---  
read | None | `GetNamespace` | none  
manage | OBJECTSTORAGE_NAMESPACE_READ OBJECTSTORAGE_NAMESPACE_UPDATE | `GetNamespace` with optional `compartmentId` parameter `GetNamespaceMetadata` `UpdateNamespaceMetadata` | none  
[buckets](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/policyreference/objectstoragepolicyreference.htm)
Verbs | Permissions | APIs Fully Covered | APIs Partially Covered  
---|---|---|---  
inspect | BUCKET_INSPECT | `HeadBucket` `ListBuckets` | none  
read | INSPECT + BUCKET_READ | INSPECT + `GetBucket` `ListMultipartUploads` `GetObjectLifecyclePolicy` `GetRetentionRule` `ListRetentionRules` `GetReplicationPolicy` `ListReplicationPolicies` `ListReplicationSources` | none  
use | READ + BUCKET_UPDATE | READ + `UpdateBucket` `DeleteObjectLifecyclePolicy` `ReencryptBucket` | `PutObjectLifecyclePolicy`  
manage | USE + BUCKET_CREATE BUCKET_DELETE PAR_MANAGE RETENTION_RULE_MANAGE RETENTION_RULE_LOCK (if using optional rule locking) | USE + `CreateBucket` `DeleteBucket` `CreatePreauthenticatedRequest` `GetPreauthenticatedRequest` `ListPreauthenticatedRequest` `DeletePreauthenticatedRequest` `CreateRetentionRule` `UpdateRetentionRule` `DeleteRetentionRule` | `CreateReplicationPolicy`, `DeleteReplicationPolicy`, `MakeBucketWritable` (these operations also need `manage objects`)  
[objects](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/policyreference/objectstoragepolicyreference.htm)
Verbs | Permissions | APIs Fully Covered | APIs Partially Covered  
---|---|---|---  
inspect | OBJECT_INSPECT | `HeadObject` `ListObjects` `ListMultipartUploadParts` | none  
read | INSPECT + OBJECT_READ | INSPECT + `GetObject` | none  
use | READ + OBJECT_OVERWRITE | READ + `ReencryptObject` | READ + `PutObject` (USE allows `PutObject` to overwrite existing objects, but creating a new object also requires OBJECT_CREATE) `CreateMultipartUpload`, `UploadPart`, `CommitMultipartUpload` (these operations also need `manage objects`)  
manage | USE + OBJECT_CREATE OBJECT_DELETE OBJECT_VERSION_DELETE OBJECT_RESTORE OBJECT_UPDATE_TIER | USE + `CreateObject` `RenameObject` `RestoreObject` `DeleteObject` `DeleteObjectVersion` `UpdateObjectStorageTier` `CreateMultipartUpload` `UploadPart` `CommitMultipartUpload` `AbortMultipartUpload` | `PutObjectLifecyclePolicy` (also needs `manage objects`)  `CreateReplicationPolicy`, `DeleteReplicationPolicy`, `MakeBucketWritable` (these operations also need `manage buckets`)  
## Permissions Required for Each API Operation ðŸ”— 
The following table lists the API operations in a logical order, grouped by resource type.
For information about permissions, see [Permissions](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/policyadvancedfeatures.htm#Permissi).
API Operation | Permissions Required to Use the Operation  
---|---  
`GetNamespace` |  API requires no permissions and returns the caller's namespace. Use the API to validate your credentials. OBJECTSTORAGE_NAMESPACE_READ permission is required if you include the optional `compartmentId` parameter. Use the `compartmentId` parameter to determine the namespace for a third-party tenancy.  
`GetNamespaceMetadata` | OBJECTSTORAGE_NAMESPACE_READ  
`UpdateNamespaceMetadata` | OBJECTSTORAGE_NAMESPACE_UPDATE  
`CreateBucket` | BUCKET_CREATE  
`UpdateBucket` | BUCKET_UPDATE  
`GetBucket` | BUCKET_READ  
`HeadBucket` | BUCKET_INSPECT  
`ListBuckets` | BUCKET_INSPECT  
`DeleteBucket` | BUCKET_DELETE  
`ReencryptBucket` | BUCKET_UPDATE  
`PutObject` |  The permission required depends on whether or not the object already exists in the bucket:
  * OBJECT_CREATE is required when an object with that name does not already exist in the bucket.
  * OBJECT_OVERWRITE is required when an object with that name already exists in the bucket.
