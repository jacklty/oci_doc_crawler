### Comments
A policy that uses `<verb> virtual-network-family` is equivalent to writing one with a separate `<verb> <individual resource-type>` statement for each of the individual resource-types.
See the table in [Details for Verb + Resource-Type Combinations](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/policyreference/corepolicyreference_topic-Details_for_Verb__ResourceType_Combinations.htm#Core "Core services details for verb and resource type combinations.") for details of the API operations covered by each verb, for each individual resource-type included in `virtual-network-family`.

### Comments
A policy that uses `<verb> instance-family` or `<verb> compute-management-family` is equivalent to writing one with a separate `<verb> <individual resource-type>` statement for each of the individual resource-types in the family.
