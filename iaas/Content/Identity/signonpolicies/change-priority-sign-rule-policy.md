# Changing the Priority of a Rule for a Sign-On Policy
If you have more than one sign-on rule for a sign-on policy, you can change the priority of a rule to change the order in which the identity domain evaluates it.
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Domains**.
  2. Click the name of the identity domain that you want to work in. You might need to change the compartment to find the domain that you want.
  3. Select **Security** , and then select **Sign-on policies**.
  4. On the **Sign-on policies** page, select the name of the sign-on policy that you want to add the rule work with
  5. Under **Resources** , select **Sign-on rules**.
  6. **Edit priority**.
  7. Select the up or down arrow next to the rule to move it to the position in the listed order that you want the rule applied.
For example, if the sign-on rule is currently listed fourth, and you want the identity domain to evaluate it first, select the up arrow next to the rule until it's at the top of the list. That sign-on rule now has a priority of 1, and the rule that was listed first now has a priority of 2.
  8. Select **Save changes**.
