# Managing Sign-On Policies
This topic describes how to create, activate, update, deactivate, and delete a sign-on policies for an identity domain.
## About Sign-On Policies and Sign-On Rules ðŸ”— 
A sign-on policy uses sign-on rules to define criteria that determine whether to allow a user to sign in to an identity domain or an application.
All identity domains come with a **Default Sign-On Policy**. If your identity domain has been preconfigured with the **Security Policy for OCI Console** sign-on policy, then we recommend that you used that policy. You can add additional sign-on policies as needed. Prioritize sign-on rules for a sign-on policy to specify the order in which the rules are to be evaluated.
### The "Default" Sign-On Policy ðŸ”— 
All identity domain include an active **Default Sign-On Policy** that contains a **Default Sign-On Rule**. 
By default, this **Default Sign-On Rule** allows all users to sign in to the identity domain with a username and password. You can build upon this policy by adding other sign-on rules to it. By adding these rules, you can prevent some of your users from signing in to the identity domain. Or, you can allow them to sign in, but prompt them for an additional factor to access resources that are protected by the identity domain, such as the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console.
For example, you can create two sign-on rules for the **Default Sign-On Policy**. The first rule prevents any users from signing in to the identity domain if they're using an IP address that falls within the range of a network perimeter that you defined named: _Denied Network Perimeters_. The second rule requires users who belong to a particular group (for example, the _UA Developers Group_) to be prompted for a second factor as part of the 2-Step Verification process named: _UA Developers Group_. All other users will be able to sign in without being prompted for a second factor.
**Important** For the **Default Sign-On Rule** , never set access for all of your users to be denied. If users don't meet the criteria of any other rules you define that allow them to sign in to the identity domain, they will be prevented from accessing identity domain-protected resources. Also, configure the identity domain to evaluate this sign-on rule last because, by default, it allows all users to sign in to the identity domain.
### The "Security Policy for OCI Console" Sign-On Policy ðŸ”— 
The **Security Policy for OCI Console** sign-on policy is activated by default and preconfigured with Oracle security best practices.
  * The following factors needed for this sign-on policy are already enabled: **Mobile app passcode** , **Mobile app notification** , **Bypass code** , and **Fast ID Online (FIDO) authenticator**.
  * The **OCI Console** application has been added to the policy.
  * The sign-on policy comes with two active sign-on rules: 
[![The rules in the Security Policy for OCI Console sign-on policy](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/libraries/global-images/security-iam-policy-rules.png)](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/libraries/global-images/security-iam-policy-rules.png)
    * **MFA for administrators** : The rule is first in priority order. This preconfigured rule requires that all users in the _**Administrators** group_ and all users with an _administrator role_ must enroll in MFA and must supply an additional factor every time they sign in. 
**Note** You can remove this rule and use the **MFA for all users** rule to require _all users_ (including administrators) to enroll in MFA. Or you can leave this rule in place and _all users_ (including administrators) will still be required to enroll in MFA when the **MFA for all users** rule is evaluated.
    * **MFA for all users** : The rule is second in priority order. This preconfigured rule requires that _all users_ must enroll in MFA and must supply an additional factor every time they sign in.
**Note** If you don't want to require MFA for _all users_ at this time, you can make this rule _optional_ and users will have the option to enroll into MFA. Or you can remove this rule and keep the **MFA for administrators** so that only administrators must enroll in MFA.


**Important** Whichever rule you decide to keep, exclude at least one administrator from the rule. If you keep both rules, make the change to both rules. See [Creating a Sign-On Policy](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/signonpolicies/add-sign-policy.htm) to learn how to exclude users from a sign-on rule.
To set up MFA using the **Security Policy for OCI Console** sign-on policy see the best practices at [Identity Domains With the "Security Policy for OCI Console" Sign-On Policy](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Security/Reference/iam_security_topic-iam_mfa_identity_domains_signon_policy.htm).
### Additional Sign-On Policies ðŸ”— 
You can create sign-on policies and associate them with specific apps. When a user uses one of these apps to attempt to sign in to the identity domain, the identity domain checks to see if the app has any sign-on policies associated with it. If so, then the identity domain evaluates the criteria of the sign-on rules assigned to the policy. If there are no sign-on policies for the app, then the **Default Sign-On Policy** is evaluated.
### The Priority of Sign-On Rules for a Policy ðŸ”— 
Because you can define multiple sign-on rules for a sign-on policy, the identity domain must know the order in which the rules are to be evaluated. To do this, you can set the priority of the rules.
Using the sign-on rules from the **Default Sign-On Policy** example above, you can have the _Denied Network Perimeters_ sign-on rule evaluated first, and the _UA Developers Group_ sign-on rule evaluated next. If a user meets the criteria of the _Denied Network Perimeters_ sign-on rule (that is, the IP address used to attempt to sign in to the identity domain falls within the IP range that you defined in the network perimeter), the user is prevented from accessing identity domain-protected resources. If the user doesn't match the criteria for this rule, then the rule with the next highest priority is evaluated. For this example, this is the _UA Developers Group_ rule. If the user is a member of the _UA Developers Group_ , they will be prompted for an additional factor to sign in to the identity domain. If the user is not a member of the _UA Developers Group_ , the rule with the next highest priority is evaluated. For this example, this is the **Default Sign-On Rule**. Because this rule, by default, allows all users to sign in to the identity domain, the user will be able to sign in without being prompted for a second factor.
## Required Policy or Role ðŸ”— 
Required policy or role.
To manage sign-on policies, you must have one of the following access grants:
  * Be a member of the Administrators group
  * Be granted the identity domain administrator, security administrator, or application administrator role
  * Be a member of a group granted `manage identity-domains`
