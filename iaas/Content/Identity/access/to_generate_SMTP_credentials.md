# Generating SMTP Credentials
Use the Console to generate SMTP credentials.
  1. View the user's details:
     * If you're generating SMTP credentials for _yourself_ : In the navigation bar, select the **Profile** menu and then select **User settings** or **My profile** , depending on the option that you see.
     * If you're an administrator generating SMTP credentials for _another user_ : Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Domains**. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Users**. Locate the user in the list, and then click the user's name to view the details.
  2. Under **Resources** , click **SMTP credentials**.
  3. Click **Generate credentials**.
  4. Enter a **Description** of the SMTP credentials in the dialog box.
  5. Click **Generate credentials**. A user name and password are displayed.
Click **Copy** to copy the password immediately, because you can't retrieve it again after closing the dialog box, for security reasons.
If you're an administrator generating SMTP credentials for another user, you need to securely deliver them to the user by providing them verbally, printing them out, or sending them through a secure email service.
  6. When you are finished, click **Close**.
