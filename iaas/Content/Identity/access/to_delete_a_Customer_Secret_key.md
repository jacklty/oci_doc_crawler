# Deleting a Customer Secret Key
Use the Console to delete a customer secret key.
The following procedure works for a regular user or an administrator. Administrators can delete a customer secret key for either another user or themselves.
  1. View the user's details:
     * If you're deleting a customer secret key for _yourself_ : 
Open the **Profile** menu, and then click **My Profile**.
     * If you're an administrator deleting a customer secret key for _another user_ : Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Domains**. Select the name of the identity domain that you want to work in. You might need to change the compartment to find the domain that you want. Then, select **Users**. Locate the user in the list, and then select the user's name to view the details.
  2. Under **Resources** , select **Customer secret keys**.
  3. Select the checkbox for the customer secret key you want to delete, and then select **Delete**.
  4. Confirm when prompted.


The customer secret key is no longer available to use with the Amazon S3 Compatibility API.
