# Managing User Credentials
Learn how users can manage their own credentials and what administrators can do with various types of user credentials for other users.
This topic describes the basics of working with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Identity and Access Management (IAM) user credentials. If you're not already familiar with the available credentials, see [Working with User Credentials](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/usercred/usercredentials.htm#user_credentials). 
**Important** If you need help signing in to the Console, see [Sign In to the Console](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/GSG/Tasks/signingin.htm).
