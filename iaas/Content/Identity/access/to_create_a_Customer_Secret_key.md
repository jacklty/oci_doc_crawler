# Creating a Customer Secret Key
Use the Console to create a customer secret key.
  1. View the user's details:
     * If you're creating a customer secret key for yourself: 
Open the **Profile** menu, and then click **My Profile**.
     * If you're an administrator creating a customer secret key for another user: Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Domains**. Select the name of the identity domain that you want to work in. You might need to change the compartment to find the domain that you want. Then, select **Users**. Locate the user in the list, and then select the user's name to view the details.
  2. Under **Resources** , select **Customer secret keys**.
A customer secret key consists of an access key/secret key pair. Oracle automatically generates the access key when you or your administrator generates the secret key to create the customer secret key.
  3. Select **Generate secret key**.
  4. Select **Name** to enter a friendly name for the key, and then select **Generate secret key**.
The generated secret key is displayed in the **Generate secret key** dialog box. At the same time, Oracle generates the access key that is paired with the secret key. The newly generated customer secret key is added to the list of **Customer secret keys**. 
  5. Select **Copy** to copy the secret key immediately, because you can't retrieve the secret key again after closing the dialog box, for security reasons.
If you're an administrator creating a secret key for another user, you need to securely deliver it to the user by providing it verbally, printing it out, or sending it through a secure email service.
  6. When you are finished, select **Close**.
  7. To show the access key, locate the secret key in the list of customer secret keys, and then select the access key in the **Access key** column. To copy the access key, while the access key is displayed, select **Copy**.
