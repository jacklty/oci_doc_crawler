# Deleting an OAuth 2.0 Client Credential
Use the Console to delete an OAuth 2.0 client credential.
The following procedure works for a regular user or an administrator. Administrators can delete an auth token for either another user or themselves.
  1. View the user's details:
     * If you're deleting an OAuth 2.0 Client Credential for _yourself_ : In the navigation bar, select the **Profile** menu and then select **User settings** or **My profile** , depending on the option that you see.
     * If you're an administrator deleting an auth token for _another user_ : Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Domains**. Select the name of the identity domain that you want to work in. You might need to change the compartment to find the domain that you want. Then, select **Users**. Locate the user in the list, and then select the user's name to view the details.
  2. On the left side of the page, select **OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials**.
  3. For the OAuth 2.0 Client Credential you want to delete, select **Delete**.
  4. Confirm when prompted.


The OAuth 2.0 Client Credential is no longer available to use.
