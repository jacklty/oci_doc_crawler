# Creating an Auth Token
Use the Console to create an auth token.
  1. View the user's details:
     * If you're creating an auth token for yourself: 
Open the **Profile** menu, and then click **My Profile**.
     * If you're an administrator creating an auth token for another user: Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Domains**. Select the name of the identity domain that you want to work in. You might need to change the compartment to find the domain that you want. Then, select **Users**. Locate the user in the list, and then select the user's name to view the details.
  2. Under **Resources** , select **Auth tokens**.
  3. Select **Generate token**.
  4. Enter a description that indicates what this token is for, for example, "Swift password token".
  5. Select **Generate token**.
The new token string is displayed.
  6. Select **Copy** to copy the token string immediately, because you can't retrieve it again after closing the dialog box.
  7. When you are finished, select **Close**.


If you're an administrator creating an auth token for another user, you need to securely deliver it to the user by providing it verbally, printing it out, or sending it through a secure email service.
