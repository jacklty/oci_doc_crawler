# Deleting an API Signing Key
You can use the Console to delete an API signing key.
The following procedure works for a regular user or an administrator. Administrators can delete an API key for either another user or themselves. 
  1. View the user's details:
     * If you're deleting an API key for _yourself_ : 
Open the **Profile** menu, and then click **My Profile**.
     * If you're an administrator deleting an API key for _another user_ : Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Domains**. Select the name of the identity domain that you want to work in. You might need to change the compartment to find the domain that you want. Then, select **Users**. Locate the user in the list, and then click the user's name to view the details.
  2. Under **Resources** , click **API keys**. The list of API key fingerprints is displayed.
  3. Select the check box for the API key you want to delete, and then click **Delete**.
  4. Confirm when prompted.

The API key is no longer valid for sending API requests.
