# Unblocking a User
Unblock a user as an administrator.
If you're an administrator, you can unblock a user who has tried 10 times in a row to sign in to the Console unsuccessfully. See [Unlocking a User](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/users/unlock-user-accounts.htm#top "Unlock a user account in an OCI IAM identity domain.").
