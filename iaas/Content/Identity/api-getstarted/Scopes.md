# Scopes
Using the scope parameter, the access token can grant different levels of access to multiple IAM identity domain APIs.
Scopes provide a way to more specifically define a set of resources and operations that an access token allows. Scopes represent intent. When a client requests an access token, the scopes asked for indicate the kind of functionality a client wants to use when presenting the access token.
Additionally, different types of applications use different access token grants. Trusted applications (such as backend services) may request access tokens directly on behalf of users. Web applications typically need to first validate the user's identity and optionally obtain the user's consent.
Use the `urn:opc:idm:__myscopes__` scope when you need to obtain an access token that contains all the permitted identity domain scopes. Access tokens are returned that contain all applicable identity domain scopes based on the privileges represented by the identity domain application roles granted to the requesting client and the user being specified by the client's request (if present). This scope isn't granted directly to any identity domain administrator role.
Use the `urn:opc:idm:role.<r_name>` scope (for example, `urn:opc:idm:role.User%20Administrator)` when you need to obtain an access token that contains the applicable scopes of a specific role, provided that both the client and the user are granted the specific role. For example, to request an access token with a role-based scope of user administrator and application administrator:
**Request Example**
```
curl -i
-H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=UTF-8'
--request POST https://<domainURL>/oauth2/v1/token 
-d 'grant_type=password&username=<user-name>&password=<example-password>&client_id=<client-id>&client_assertion_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Aclient-assertion-type%3Ajwt-bearer&client_assertion=<client-assertion>&scope=urn:opc:idm:role.User%2520Administrator urn:opc:idm:role.Application%2520Administrator'
```

The access token generated would contain the applicable scopes for the user administrator and the application administrator as long as both the client and the user are granted these roles. For example, a client has Role1, Role2, and Role3. A User has Role1, Role2, and Role 4. The scopes included in the request for the access token are Role1 and Role3. The access token generated would contain only scopes for Role1.
Scope claims can have multiple space separated scopes. If a scope name contains a space, the server can't determine the correct scope boundary. This can happen when a role name is used in the scope. In the request example, the roles "user administrator" and "application administrator" have spaces that have been URL encoded: `scope=urn:opc:idm:role.User**%2520**Administrator           urn:opc:idm:role.Application**%2520**Administrator.`
To avoid space issues in role names, you must encode the role names twice using URL encoding:
**Example Java Code**
```
String scope = "scope=urn:opc:idm:role." + URLEncoder.encode(URLEncoder.encode("User Administrator", "UTF-8"), "UTF-8");
scope = scope + " urn:opc:idm:role." + URLEncoder.encode(URLEncoder.encode("Application Administrator", "UTF-8"), "UTF-8");
```

**No Scopes Defined for an App**
If there are no scopes defined for an application (for example, wanting the user to simply sign in and acquire an OAuth access token), the following scopes can be specified in browser-based login flow requests to the `/oauth2/v1/authorize` endpoint:
  * `scope=openid`: The resulting access token can be used with `/oauth2/c1/userinfo`, which provides the bare minimum user information.
  * `scope=openid               approles groups`: The resulting access token can be used with `/oauth2/v1/userinfo` to get the user's roles and groups.


## Using Trust Scopes ðŸ”— 
Trust scopes define how an OAuth client accesses resources. Trust scopes allow a trusted or confidential client application to acquire an access token that gives access to any of the resources within an identity domain (`Account`), to other resources based on defined tags (`Tags`), or to only those services where an explicit association between the client and the service (`Explicit`) exists.
**Note** The option to define the `trustScope` parameter is available to only trusted and confidential client applications. The option isn't available to public client applications.
Use the following guidelines when using a trust scope:
**Note** The `trustScope` attributes of `Account,` `Tags`, and `Explicit` are named **All** (for `Account`), **Tagged** (for `Tags`), and **Specific** (for `Explicit`) in the identity domain Console.
  * Use only the `urn:opc:resource:consumer::all` scope in the request. An invalid scope error is returned if you attempt to include both the `urn:opc:resource:consumer::all` scope and another scope in the same request, such as `urn:opc:idm:__myscopes__.`
  * Requesting an access token using the `urn:opc:resource:consumer::all` scope doesn't return an access token that provides access to the identity domains admin APIs. You must continue to use the scope: `urn:opc:idm:__myscopes__` to access the admin APIs. See [Scopes.](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/api-getstarted/Scopes.htm#Scopes "Using the scope parameter, the access token can grant different levels of access to multiple IAM identity domain APIs.")
  * The scope requested by the Client app should always exist and match, either directly or hierarchically, the client's defined allowed scopes to allow the client access to the resource.
  * The `trustScope` value of `Explicit` is assigned by default to trusted and confidential client applications and allows your client application to acquire an access token with permissions based on an explicit association between the client and target services. To use the `All` or `Tagged` option, you must update the client application with either the `trustScope` value of `All` or `Tags.`
  * For identity propagation token requests using the `urn:opc:resource:consumer::all` scope, the resulting access token doesn't include the `urn:opc:resource:consumer::all` scope.


The following links provide more information on each `trustScope` available:

You can specify multiple scopes belonging to different resources in a single Authorization request or token request and obtain multiple access tokens in return with each of them containing the scopes for each resource.")


### Using the Account Trust Scope ðŸ”— 
The `Account` trust scope allows a trusted or confidential client application to get an access token that gives access to any of the services that are in the same identity domain without requiring explicit association with the target services.
**Note** The option to define the `trustScope` parameter is available to only trusted and confidential client applications. The option isn't available to public client applications.
To use the `Account` trust scope:
  1. Assign the value of `Account` to the `trustScope` parameter for the appropriate trusted client application.
**Note** The `trustScope` attribute of `Account` is named **All** in the identity domain Console.
![A part of an example request with a red arrow pointing to the trustScope parameter.](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Resources/Images/1Token.png)
  2. Request an access token using the trusted or confidential client and request the scope `urn:opc:resource:consumer::all.` The access token in the response contains the audience `urn:opc:resource:scope:account` and the scope `urn:opc:resource:consumer::all`, which gives access to any of the services that are in the same domain without requiring explicit association with the target services.


**Note** The requested scope should always exist and match, either directly or hierarchically, the client's defined allowed scopes to allow the client access to the resource.
**Using Fine-Grained Scopes**
In addition to using the `urn:opc:resource:consumer::all` scope, you can also specify the following fine-grained scopes:
  * `urn:opc:resource:consumer:paas::read`
  * `urn:opc:resource:consumer:paas:stack::all`
  * `urn:opc:resource:consumer:paas:analytics::read`

The requested scope from the client app must match, either directly or hierarchically, at least one of the client's allowed scopes to allow the client access to the resource. For example, a client app uses the `urn:opc:resource:consumer:paas:analytics::read` scope in its request for access to a resource. If the scope directly matches an allowed scope defined, in the returned access token, the audience is `urn:opc:resource:scope:account` and the scope is `urn:opc:resource:consumer:paas:analytics::read.`
If the allowed scope defined by the client is `urn:opc:resource:consumer:paas::read`, then the client app is allowed to access the resource hierarchically if the client requests one of the following scopes: `urn:opc:resource:consumer:paas::read` or `urn:opc:resource:consumer:paas:analytics::read.` However, if the requested scope is `urn:opc:resource:consumer:paas:analytics::write,` then the client isn't allowed access to the resource, because that isn't one of the allowed scopes defined by the client app.
**Request and Response Examples**
The following examples show request and response examples for the client credentials and resource owner grant flows.

"access_token":"eyJ4...pNYM0M", 
"token_type":"Bearer", 
"expires_in":3600,
"refresh_token":"AQIDBAUi....djF9NCA=" 
}
```

### Using the Tags Trust Scope ðŸ”— 
The `Tags` trust scope allows a trusted or confidential client application to get an access token that gives access to other resources based on the defined tags.
**Note** The option to define the `trustScope` parameter is available to only trusted and confidential client applications. The option isn't available to public client applications.
To use the `Tags` trust scope:
  1. Assign the value of `Tags` to the `trustScope` parameter to enable the client application to access tags from other applications.
**Note** The `trustScope` attribute of `Tags` is named **Tagged** in the identity domain Console.
  2. Define the `key:value` pair for the `AllowedTags` parameter.
**Note** These steps assume that the appropriate Resource App has defined `key:value` pairs for the `Tags` attribute and that at least one `key:value` pair from the list of the `allowedTags` attribute of the Client App match one `key:value` pair of the `Tags` attribute of the Resource App.
![A part of an example request with a red arrows pointing to the trustScope parameter and the allowedTags parameter.](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Resources/Images/Tags.png)
  3. Request an access token using the trusted or confidential client and request the scope `urn:opc:resource:consumer::all.` The access token in the response contains the audience `urn:opc:resource:scope:tag=<base64             encoded JSON>` and the scope `urn:opc:resource:consumer::all`, which gives access to Resource Apps that have tags that match the allowed tags specified in the Client App.


**Note** The requested scope must always exist and match, either directly or hierarchically, the client's defined allowed scopes to allow the client access to the resource.
**Using Fine-Grained Scopes**
In addition to using the `urn:opc:resource:consumer::all` scope, you can also specify the following fine-grained scopes:
  * `urn:opc:resource:consumer:paas::read`
  * `urn:opc:resource:consumer:paas:stack::all`
  * `urn:opc:resource:consumer:paas:analytics::read`

The requested scope from the client app must match, either directly or hierarchically, at least one of the client's allowed scopes to allow the client access to the resource. For example, a client app uses the `urn:opc:resource:consumer:paas:analytics::read` scope in its request for access to a resource. If the scope directly matches an allowed scope defined, then in the returned access token the audience is `urn:opc:resource:scope:tag=<base64 encoded JSON>` and the scope is `urn:opc:resource:consumer:paas:analytics::read.`
If the allowed scope defined by the client is `urn:opc:resource:consumer:paas::read`, then the client app is allowed to access the resource hierarchically if the client requests one of the following scopes: `urn:opc:resource:consumer:paas::read` or `urn:opc:resource:consumer:paas:analytics::read.` However, if the requested scope is `urn:opc:resource:consumer:paas:analytics::write,` then the client isn't allowed access to the resource, because that isn't one of the allowed scopes defined by the client app.
**Request and Response Examples**
The following examples show request and response examples for the client credentials flow using the `urn:opc:resource:consumer::all` scope.
**Request Example**
```
curl -i
-H 'Authorization: Basic MjA3Mz....zllNjI2' 
-H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8' 
--request POST 'https://tenant101.idcs.internal.oracle.com:8943/oauth2/v1/token'
-d 'grant_type=client_credentials&scope=urn:opc:resource:consumer::all'
```

**Response Example**
```
{
"access_token""eyJ4NX....ZbDtAw", 
"token_type":"Bearer", "expires_in":3600
}
```

**Note** The access token contains the audience `urn:opc:resource:scope:tag=<base64 encoded JSON>` and the scope `urn:opc:resource:consumer::all.` The following is an example of a decoded audience: `aud:["urn:opc:resource:scope:tag=eyAidGFncyI6WyB7ICJrZXkiOiJjb2xvciIsInZhbHVlIjoiZ3JlZW4ifSAsICB7ICJrZXkiOiJjb2xvciIsInZhbHVlIjoiYmx1ZSJ9IF19"]`
The following examples show request and response examples for the client credentials flow using a fully qualified scope.
**Request Example**
```
curl -i
-H 'Authorization: Basic MzRjYz....Q3OWVk' 
-H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8' 
--request POST 'https://<domainURL>/oauth2/v1/token'
-d 'grant_type=client_credentials&scope=http://abccorp1.com/scope1'
```

**Response Example**
```
{
"access_token""eyJ4NXzF.....rT5SH7sUw", 
"token_type":"Bearer",
"expires_in":3600 
} 
```

### Using the Explicit Trust Scope ðŸ”— 
The `Explicit` trust scope defines trust scope for only those services where an explicit association between the client and the target service exists.
**Note** The option to define the `trustScope` parameter is available to only trusted and confidential client applications. The option isn't available to public client applications.
You don't have to do anything to use the `Explicit` trust scope because this is the default assigned to trusted and confidential client application. To use the `Account` or `Tags` option, you must update the client application with the `trustScope` value of either `Account` or `Tags.`
**Note** The `trustScope` attribute of `Explicit` is named **Specific** in the identity domain.
See [Using the Account Trust Scope](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/api-getstarted/Scopes.htm#AccountScope "The Account trust scope allows a trusted or confidential client application to get an access token that gives access to any of the services that are in the same identity domain without requiring explicit association with the target services.") and [Using the Tags Trust Scope](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/api-getstarted/Scopes.htm#TaggedScope "The Tags trust scope allows a trusted or confidential client application to get an access token that gives access to other resources based on the defined tags.").
**Request and Response Examples**
The request and response examples show the client credentials flow using a fully qualified scope.
**Request Example**
```
curl -i 
-H 'Authorization: Basic MzRjYz....Q3OWVk' 
-H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8' 
--request POST 'https://<domainURL>/oauth2/v1/token' 
-d 'grant_type=client_credentials&scope=http://abccorp1.com/scope1'
```

**Response Example**
```
{
"access_token""eyJ4NXzF.....rT5SH7sUw", 
"token_type":"Bearer",
"expires_in":3600 
}
```

### Using the Explicit Trust Scopes from Multiple Resources ðŸ”— 
The `Explicit` trust scope defines trust scope for only those services where an explicit association between the client and the target service exists. You can specify multiple scopes belonging to different resources in a single Authorization request or token request and obtain multiple access tokens in return with each of them containing the scopes for each resource.
To use this feature: 
  * You must specify the newly defined scope, `urn:opc:resource:multiresourcescope` in the Authorization request or token request. Token requests will fail if multiple scopes belonging to different resources are specified without this scope.
  * The OAuth Client must be able to parse the token response that includes multiple access tokens and use each token to access each resource service.


**Note** You can use this feature with all the grant types except for the Implicit flow. See [Implicit Grant Type](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/api-getstarted/ImplicitGT.htm#ImplicitGT "Use this grant type when the custom application can't keep client credentials confidential and receives an access token directly from an authorization request rather than through an intermediate authorization code.").
See [Using the Explicit (Specific) Trust Scope](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/api-getstarted/Scopes.htm#ExplicitScope "The Explicit trust scope defines trust scope for only those services where an explicit association between the client and the target service exists.") for more information about the explicit trust scopes.
