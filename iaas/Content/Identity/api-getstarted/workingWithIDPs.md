# Working with Identity Providers
Configure SAML JIT provisioning for an identity provider and configure social identity providers.
This section contains the following topics:
  * [Configuring SAML JIT Provisioning](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/api-getstarted/samlJitApi.htm#samlJitApi "SAML Just-In-Time \(JIT\) Provisioning automates user account creation when the user first tries to perform SSO and the user doesn't yet exist in the identity domain. In addition to automatic user creation, SAML JIT Provisioning allows granting and revoking group memberships as part of provisioning. SAML JIT Provisioning can be configured to update provisioned users so the users' attributes in the Service Provider \(SP\) store can be kept in sync with the Identity Provider \(IdP\) user store attributes.")
  * [Passing Custom Parameters to a Social Identity Provider](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/api-getstarted/passCustomerParamsIdP.htm#customSocialIDPs "Use the identity domains REST API to pass a custom parameter for social identity provider \(IdP\) configurations. For each social IdP, you can define both static and dynamic custom parameters, which are passed as-is to the IdP when sent in an authorization request.")
  * [Authenticating Using a Custom Social Identity Provider](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/api-getstarted/customSocialIDPs.htm#customSocialIDPs "Configure an identity domain to authenticate using a custom social identity provider \(IdP\).")
