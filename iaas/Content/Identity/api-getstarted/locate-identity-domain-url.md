# Finding an Identity Domain URL
You need the Domain URL to access a PaaS product that's integrated with identity domains using the REST APIs.
Go to the **Domain information** tab to see detail information about an identity domain including the **Domain URL**. 
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Domains**. Select the identity domain that you want to work in.
  2. On the **Domain information** tab, view or copy the **Domain URL**. 
**Note** The identity domain ID is part of the Domain URL. For example: `https://<IdentityDomainID>.identity.oraclecloud.com/admin/v1/`.
