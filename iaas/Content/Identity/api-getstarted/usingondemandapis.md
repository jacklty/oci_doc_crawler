# Using the On-Demand MFA API to Develop Custom Sign-In Page
This use case provides a step-by-step example of using the identity domains REST API to authenticate users and perform multifactor enrollment and authentication.
**Note** Use this Authenticate API only if you're building your own end-to-end login experience by developing a custom sign-in application to be used by identity domains.
**Note** This Authenticate API can't be used to integrate your applications with identity domains for single sign-on purposes.
The On Demand MFA API is based on the concept of a state machine. Request responses inform an application client what has to be done next rather than requiring users to have third-party cookies enabled in their browsers. Third-party cookies enabled in browsers can pose problems, especially for B2C applications where controls on end-user behavior can't be enforced. The `requestState` provided in each request response is used in the next request, providing the client with the information that it needs to process the request, and then provide the next set of operations allowed.
The On Demand MFA API can:
  * Support user enrollment with MFA factors enabled by the administrator
  * Strengthen the security of password-based authentication using Multifactor Authentication (MFA) by requiring additional verification, such as using a time-based one-time passcode or an SMS passcode.
  * Perform MFA enrollment, MFA verification and User Authentication Factor management. 


The following example sets are included in this use case:

  * [usingondemandapis.htm#concept_l3p_vyg_ngb__mfa_initiate_verification](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/api-getstarted/usingondemandapis.htm#concept_l3p_vyg_ngb__mfa_initiate_verification)
  * [usingondemandapis.htm#concept_l3p_vyg_ngb__mfa_verify_factor](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/api-getstarted/usingondemandapis.htm#concept_l3p_vyg_ngb__mfa_verify_factor)


**Note** The examples in this section use `userGUID` in the requests. You may request both `userGUID` and `userOcid` in your requests.
#### Step1: Initiate Verification of the Preferred Factor  ðŸ”— 
This step initiates the verification of a user's preferred factor. If you need to use the verify factor API without providing the `userGUID`, you can provide a user unique id such as username as the `userId`. The `userIdType` in the request indicates what type of credential the user is passing as the value for the `userId`. The following `userIdType` values are accepted: 
  * USER_GUID - For example, here `userId` should contain USER_GUID such as "7b3d902ab05b4214" 
  * USER_NAME - For example, here `userId` should contain USER_NAME such as John.


The `userId` attribute contains the actual value of the user credential that's passed. 
**Request Example**
The following example shows the POST request to **`{{HOST}}/mfa/v1/requests`**endpoint in JSON format.
```
{
  "userId":"{{userGUID}}",
  "userIdType": "USER_GUID"
}
```

**Response Example**
The following example shows the contents of the POST response to **`{{HOST}}/mfa/v1/requests`**endpoint in JSON format after initiating preferred factor on the preferred ID :
```

{   
"status": "success",
"requestId": "f843736e-cbd8-4548-b41f-343b624a79fc",
"userGUID": "589879c55b7340518141eab82493f0cc", 
"factorId": "88178d80636a428393a5674ba46dc867",  
"method": "SMS",  
"displayName": "+4455665455",  
"requestState": "GwHJr3RvycjNEv.....MhQTLmWYzA/LVp0s"
}
```

In the response, the `requestId` value is the unique identifier generated for this request. Include the `requestId` in every subsequent call to complete factor verification. The `factorId` is the preferred device on which it was initiated. The `method` is the factor that the user has initiated. The `requestState` contains the contextual data needed to process the request.
In this example, an `otpCode`(in case of SMS and EMAIL factor) is sent using SMS to the user's mobile device. 
#### Step 2: Verify the Preferred Factor  ðŸ”— 
This step verifies the factor by passing the `otpCode` in a PATCH request to `**{{HOST}}/mfa/v1/requests/{{requestId}}**`.
The client must include the following attributes:
  * `otpCode:` the code received by the user on their device 
  * `requestState`: received in the Step 1 response 
  * `requestId`: received in the Step 1 response 


**Request Example**
The following example shows the contents of the PATCH request in JSON format: 
```
{ 
"otpCode":"170230", 
"requestState": "{{requestState}}" 
}
```

**Response Example**
The following example shows the contents of the response in JSON format: 
```
{"status":"success"} 
```

Success indicates that verification was successful.
### Initiate and Verify a Backup Factor ðŸ”— 
This use case provides a step-by-step example of using the identity domains Verification API to complete factor verification of the backup factor.

  * [Step 2: Initiate and Verify Backup Factor EMAIL](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/api-getstarted/usingondemandapis.htm#concept_l3p_vyg_ngb__section_nng_h2h_ngb)


**Note** The examples in this section use `userGUID` in the requests. You may request both `userGUID` and `userOcid` in your requests.
#### Step 1: Initiate and Verify the Backup Factor Security Questions ðŸ”— 
This step initiates the verification of a user's backup factor. The client must provide both the `factorId` and the `method` in the request. If you need to use the verify factor API without providing the `userGUID`, you can provide a user unique id such as username as the `userId`. The `userIdType` in the request indicates what type of credential the user is passing as the value for the `userId`. The following `userIdType` values are accepted: 
  * USER_GUID - For example, here `userId` should contain USER_GUID such as `"7b3d902ab05b4214"`. 
  * USER_NAME - For example, here `userId` should contain USER_NAME such as `Joe John`. 


The `userId` attribute contains the actual value of the user credential that's passed. 
To obtain a list of enrolled factors and their IDs for a user, see the [Fetch Enrolled Factors of a User](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/api-getstarted/usingondemandapis.htm#concept_l3p_vyg_ngb "This use case provides a step-by-step example of using the identity domains Verification API to fetch the factors that a user is enrolled in.")

This step activates the SMS enrollment for the user, in a PATCH request to the `**/mfa/v1/users/{{userGUID}}/factors/{{factorID}}**`endpoint.
The client must include the following attributes:
  * `otpCode:` the code received by the user on their device 
  * `requestState`: received in the Step 1 response 


**Request Example**
The following example shows the contents of the PATCH request in JSON format: 
```
{ 
"otpCode":"170230", 
"requestState": "{{requestState}}"
 }
```

**Response Example**
The following example shows the contents of the response in JSON format: 
```
{"status":"success"} 
```

Success indicates that: 
  * `OTP` is valid
  * The `userGUID` that was provided is valid
  * The user is active
  * The user account isn't locked
  * The SMS factor is enabled and factor is enrolled successfully


**Error Response Examples**
The following example shows the error message in JSON format when the `userGUID` is invalid. You get a 404 HTTP response code if the `userGUID` is invalid.```
{
  "status": "failed",
  "ecId": "0d1QwglU0000Fy",
  "cause": [
    {
      "code": "AUTH-3018",
      "message": "User not found."
    }
  ]
}
```

The following example shows the error message in JSON format when the user is locked. You get a 401 HTTP response code.
```
{
  "status": "failed",
  "ecId": "0ISDCif1Qy6wg0000A8",
  "cause": [
    {
      "code": "AUTH-1010",
      "message": "Your account is locked.Contact your system administrator."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Authentication Factor Enrollment With Factor Verification-Email  ðŸ”— 
This use case provides a step-by-step example of using the identity domains Factor Enrollment API to enroll for Multifactor Authentication (MFA) with Factor Verification.
These steps assume that relevant factors of MFA are enabled using [Configure Multi-Factor Authentication Settings](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/mfa/configure-multi-factor-authentication-settings.htm#configure-multi-factor-authentication-settings "Configure multifactor authentication \(MFA\) settings and compliance policies that define which MFA factors are required to access an identity domain in IAM, and then configure the MFA factors.").
Download the identity domains authentication use case examples collection and the global variables file from the **idcs-factor-enrollment-api** folder within the [idm-samples](https://github.com/oracle-samples/idm-samples) GitHub repository and then import them into Postman.
Use the following steps for the use case. Each step contains request and response examples:
  * [Step 1: Initiate Email Factor Enrollment ](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/api-getstarted/usingondemandapis.htm#concept_gqj_v5g_ngb__section_exs_rkg_ngb)
  * [Step 1a: Resend the OTP](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/api-getstarted/usingondemandapis.htm#concept_gqj_v5g_ngb__section_ln1_mhv_ngb)
  * [Step 2: Activate the EMAIL Factor](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/api-getstarted/usingondemandapis.htm#concept_gqj_v5g_ngb__section_gc4_4xg_ngb)


**Note** The examples in this section use `userGUID` in the requests. You may request both `userGUID` and `userOcid` in your requests.
#### Step 1: Initiate Email Factor Enrollment  ðŸ”— 
This step initiates Email enrollment. The client must include the following attribute: 
  * `method`: defines to enroll in Email. User will not pass the email id. The primary email id is automatically fetched from the user's profile.


**Request Example**
The following example shows the contents of the POST request to `**{{HOST}}/mfa/v1/users/{{userGUID}}/factors**`endpoint in JSON format:
```
{ 
"method": "EMAIL",
}
```

**Response Example**
The following example shows the contents of the response in JSON format: 
```
{
  "status": "success",
  "factorId": "30db2274140043918edb033d9fe29ff3",
  "factorStatus": "ENROLLMENT_INITIATED",
  "methods": [
    "EMAIL"
  ],
  "displayName": "user1@example.com",
  "requestState": "Vxar...bWTTA"
}
```

An `otpCode` will be sent to the user's email id, which is used to complete the enrollment. 
The response contains:
  * `requestState:` that should be passed by the client in the next step
  * `displayName:` email id of the user enrolled 
  * `method:` EMAIL factor method


Success indicates that: 
The factor enrollment was initiated.
#### Step 1a: Resend the OTP  ðŸ”— 
The following example shows the PATCH request to `**{{HOST}}/mfa/v1/users/{{userGUID}}/factors/{{factorID}}**`endpoint in JSON format.
If the user doesn't receive the OTP, this example shows how to request that an OTP be resent. The client must include the following attributes: 
  * `requestState:` received in the Step 1 response
  * `resendOtp:` to indicate that the OTP is received


**Request Example**
The following example shows the contents of the PATCH request in JSON format: 
```
{ 
"resendOtp":true, 
 "requestState": "QK1.....y+OFP//0"
 }
 
```

The following example shows the contents of the response in JSON format: 
```
{  
"status": "success",   
"factorId": "30db2274140043918edb033d9fe29ff3",
"factorStatus": "ENROLLMENT_INITIATED",  
"methods": ["EMAIL"],
"displayName": "username@example.com", 
"requestState": "AmgsMN.....2sk4SI" 
}
  
```

The response contains: 
  * `requestState`: that should be passed by the client in the next step
  * `displayName`: email id fetched from the user's profile 
  * `method`: the list of method(s) being enrolled in EMAIL method
  * `factorId`: unique identifier generated for the factor being enrolled


Success indicates that: 
  * The `userGUID` or `userOcid` that was provided is valid
  * The user is active
  * The user account isn't locked
  * The EMAIL factor is enabled


#### Step 2: Activate the EMAIL Factor ðŸ”— 
This step activates the EMAIL enrollment for the user, in a **PATCH** request to the `**/mfa/v1/users/{{userGUID}}/factors/{{factorID}}**`endpoint.
The client must include the following attributes:
  * `otpCode:` the code received by the user on their email id 
  * `requestState`: received in the Step 1 response 


**Request Example**
The following example shows the contents of the PATCH request in JSON format: 
```
{
"otpCode":"710130", 
"requestState": "{{requestState}}"
} 

```

**Response Example**
The following example shows the contents of the response in JSON format: 
```
{"status":"success"} 
```

Success indicates that: 
  * `OTP` is valid
  * The `userGUID` or `userOcid` that was provided is valid
  * The user is active
  * The user account isn't locked
  * The EMAIL factor is enabled and factor is enrolled successfully


**Error Response Examples**
The following example shows the error message in JSON format when the `userGUID` is invalid. You get a 404 HTTP response code if the `userGUID` or `userOcid` is invalid.```
{
  "status": "failed",
  "ecId": "0d1QwglU0000Fy",
  "cause": [
    {
      "code": "AUTH-3018",
      "message": "User not found."
    }
  ]
}
```

The following example shows the error message in JSON format when the EMAIL is disabled. You get a 401 HTTP response code.
```
{
  "status": "failed",
  "ecId": "0000M00000A",
  "cause": [
    {
      "code": "AUTH-1125",
      "message": "The EMAIL factor has been disabled."
    }
  ]
}
```
