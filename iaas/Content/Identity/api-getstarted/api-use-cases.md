Triggering an Email Verification Flow if Email Address is Already Verified |  This use case provides an example of how custom clients can re the change email flow for users who already have verified their email addresses. [Resending Email Verifications When The Email Address Is Already Verified](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/api-getstarted/trigger-email-verify-flow-if-email-already-verified.htm "After a user creates an account in an identity domain using the self-registration process, an email notification is sent to the user to verify the user's email address. After users verify their email addresses, they can no longer verify their email addresses after that.")  
Using Duo Security with an IAM identity domain |  This use case provides an example of how to use an Authenticate API with Duo Security. See [Using Duo Security with Identity Domains](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/api-getstarted/use-duosec-identity-cloud-service.htm#concept_arr_dty_pjb "These use cases provide a step-by-step example of using Duo Web SDK v2 or Duo Web SDK v4 with an identity domain.").  
Using OpenID Connect to Extend OAuth 2.0 |  This use case provides an example of how client applications can authenticate to an identity domain using OpenID connect protocol and identity domain REST APIs. See [Using OpenID Connect to Extend OAuth 2.0](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/api-getstarted/usingopenidconnect.htm#usingopenidconnect "OpenID Connect extends the OAuth 2.0 protocol to add a simple authentication and identity layer that sits on top of OAuth 2.0.").  
Using Self Service to Enroll in MFA using the SMS Factor |  This use case provides a step-by-step example of using the identity domain REST API for Self-Service enrollment in Multifactor Authentication (MFA) using SMS Factor.

Each use case also provides the required App attributes.").  
Working with OAuth 2 to Access the REST API |  This use case walks you through using an OAuth client with identity domains to access the REST APIs. See [Using OAuth 2 to Access the REST API](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/api-getstarted/OATOAuthClientWebApp.htm "The identity domains REST API supports SCIM 2.0 compliant endpoints with standard SCIM 2.0 core schemas and Oracle schema extensions to programmatically manage users, groups, applications, and identity functions, such as password management and administrative tasks. To make REST API calls to your identity domain, you need an OAuth2 access token to use for authorization. The access token provides a session \(with scope and expiration\), that your client application can use to perform tasks in an identity domain.").
