# Token Exchange Grant Type
The Token Exchange grant type allows interoperability between PaaS/SaaS services and IaaS services by performing two-way conversions between IAM proof-of-possession (PoP) tokens and identity domain OAuth tokens. A principal that has an IAM PoP token or an API key can make a request to an endpoint that supports only OAuth, without needing any other credentials if already authenticated to OCI.

  * [Token Exchange Grant Type: Exchanging a Kerberos Token for a UPST](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/api-getstarted/kerberos_token_exchange.htm#kerberos_token_exchange "Use Kerberos token exchange where Kerberos is the authentication provider and you need to exchange Kerberos tokens for IAM tokens or principals to access OCI services. You exchange Kerberos tokens for OCI user principal session tokens \(UPST\) in IAM.")
