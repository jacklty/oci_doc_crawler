# Access Grant Types
The most important step for an application in the OAuth flow is how the application receives an access token (and optionally a refresh token). A grant type is the mechanism used to retrieve the token. OAuth defines several different access grant types that represent different authorization mechanisms.
Applications can request an access token to access protected endpoints in different ways, depending on the type of grant type specified in the client application. A grant is a credential representing the resource owner's authorization to access a protected resource. Trusted applications (such as backend services) may request access tokens directly on behalf of users. This is an OAuth two-legged authorization flow. OAuth web applications typically need to first validate the user's identity and optionally obtain the user's consent. This is an OAuth three-legged authorization flow.
For example, when using the Resource Owner grant type, the resource owner's password credentials (username and password) can be used directly as an authorization grant to obtain an access token. When using the Client Credentials grant type, the client authenticates with the OAuth service, and then requests an access token. When using the Assertion grant, a user assertion is sent along with the client information when requesting access.
**Note** Although you can associate more than one grant type with an application, we recommended that you select only what your application needs to use. Each grant type that you add means that the application can talk to identity domains using any of those grant types. But, the application chooses at runtime, which grant type to use.

  * [Authorization Code Grant Type](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/api-getstarted/AuthCodeGT.htm#AuthCodeGT "Use this grant type when you want to obtain an authorization code by using an authorization server as an intermediary between the client application and the resource owner using identity domains.")
  * [Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant Type](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/api-getstarted/ROPCGT.htm#ROPCGT "Use this grant type when the resource owner has a trust relationship with the client, such as a computer OS or a highly privileged application, because the client must discard the password after using it to obtain the access token.")
  * [Client Credentials Grant Type](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/api-getstarted/CCGT.htm#CCGT "Use this grant type when authorization scope is limited to the protected resources under the control of the client or to protected resources registered with the OAuth Authorization Server.")
  * [Assertion Grant Type](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/api-getstarted/AssertGT.htm#AssertGT "Use this grant type when you want to use an existing trust relationship expressed as an assertion and without a direct user approval step at the OAuth Authorization Server.")
  * [Implicit Grant Type](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/api-getstarted/ImplicitGT.htm#ImplicitGT "Use this grant type when the custom application can't keep client credentials confidential and receives an access token directly from an authorization request rather than through an intermediate authorization code.")
  * [Refresh Token Grant Type](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/api-getstarted/RefreshGT.htm#RefreshGT "Use this grant type when you want a refresh token issued along with the access token. The refresh token is used to obtain a new access token without requiring the user to reauthenticate.")
  * [Token Exchange Grant Type](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/api-getstarted/token_exchange_grant_type.htm#token_exchange_grant_type "The Token Exchange grant type allows interoperability between PaaS/SaaS services and IaaS services by performing two-way conversions between IAM proof-of-possession \(PoP\) tokens and identity domain OAuth tokens. A principal that has an IAM PoP token or an API key can make a request to an endpoint that supports only OAuth, without needing any other credentials if already authenticated to OCI.")
    * [Token Exchange Grant Type Two-Legged Authorization Flow Example](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/api-getstarted/token_exchange_grant_type_two_legged.htm#token_exchange_grant_type_two_legged "Use the following examples to create your Token Exchange grant type requests.")
    * [Token Exchange Grant Type: Exchanging a Kerberos Token for a UPST](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/api-getstarted/kerberos_token_exchange.htm#kerberos_token_exchange "Use Kerberos token exchange where Kerberos is the authentication provider and you need to exchange Kerberos tokens for IAM tokens or principals to access OCI services. You exchange Kerberos tokens for OCI user principal session tokens \(UPST\) in IAM.")
