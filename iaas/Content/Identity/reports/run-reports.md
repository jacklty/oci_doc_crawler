# Running Reports
Run a report for an IAM identity domain.
To run IAM reports, you must be assigned to the identity domain administrator role, the audit administrator role, or the application administrator role. See [Assigning Users to Roles](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/users/assign-users-roles.htm#top "Assign users in an OCI IAM identity domain to a role.") for more information about assigning administrator roles to users.
For information about the types of reports that you can run and the filters available in them, see [Types of Reports](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/reports/understand-types-reports.htm#understand "Find out about the different reports available for an OCI IAM identity domain."). To run the diagnostic report, see [Running the Diagnostic Data Report](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/reports/run-diagnostic.htm#run-diagnostic-report "Run a diagnostic data report for an IAM identity domain.").
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Domains**.
  2. Click the name of the identity domain that you want to work in. You might need to change the compartment to find the domain that you want.
  3. **Reports**.
  4. For the report you want to run, select **View report**.
  5. On the report page, enter filter values, such as dates and user names, to search for specific information.
  6. Select **Run report**.
The report results are displayed on the page. You can download the results for the following types of reports: audit log, successful login, unsuccessful login, application access, application role privileges, and diagnostic data. IAM supports CSV report generation.
  7. Optionally, download the results by selecting **Download report**.
The report is created and saved at the location you choose or opened in Excel
