# Dormant Users Report
The dormant users reports shows users who haven't signed in to IAM since a specified date.
## Data
The dormant users report shows: 
  * The username or client. 
**Note** This just shows users who have signed in to IAM using their IAM credentials (username and password, or username and second factor). Usernames of federated users signing in using an identity provider aren't displayed.
  * The last successful sign-in date.
  * The full name associated with the username or client.
  * The primary email address for the account.


## Filtering the Results
You can filter the report to show: 
  * Results from a specific date range.
  * The username or client. This is case-sensitive and you must enter it exactly as it appears on the system.
