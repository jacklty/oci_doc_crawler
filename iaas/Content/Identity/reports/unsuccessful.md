# Unsuccessful Login Attempts Report
The unsuccessful login attempts report shows users who haven't logged in to IAM successfully.
This report returns data for the last 14 days. You can use the [OCI Audit service](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Audit/home.htm) for older data (up to 365 days).
## Data
The unsuccessful login attempts report shows: 
  * The overall number of successful and unsuccessful logins
  * The user name or client. 
**Note** This just shows users who have logged into IAM using their IAM credentials (user name and password, or user name and second factor). User names of federated users logging in using an identity provider are not displayed.
  * The date and time of the unsuccessful login.
  * Any comments about the unsuccessful login.


## Filtering the Results
You can filter the report to show: 
  * Results from the last 30 days, the last 60 days, or the last 90 days.
  * Results from a specific date range.
