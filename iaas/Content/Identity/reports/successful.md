# Successful Login Attempts Report
The successful login attempts report shows users who have signed in to IAM successfully.
This report returns data for the last 14 days. You can use the [OCI Audit service](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Audit/home.htm) for older data (up to 365 days).
## Data
The successful login attempts report shows: 
  * The username or client. 
**Note** This just shows users who have signed in to IAM using their IAM credentials (username and password, or username and second factor). Usernames of federated users signing in using an identity provider aren't displayed. 
  * The date and time of the successful sign in.
  * The provider.


## Filtering the Results
You can filter the report to show: 
  * Results from the last 30 days, the last 60 days, or the last 90 days.
  * Results from a specific date range.
