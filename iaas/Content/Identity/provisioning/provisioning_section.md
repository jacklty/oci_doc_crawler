Through synchronization, account data that's created and updated directly on the apps is pulled into an identity domain and stored for the corresponding identity domain users and groups. As a result, any changes to these records are transferred into an identity domain. So, if a user is deleted in one of your apps, then this change is propagated into the identity domain. Because of this, the state of each record is synchronized between your apps and the identity domain."): A provisioning bridge provides a link between on-premises apps and IAM.
