# Default MFA Security for Identity Domains My Profile and My Apps Pages
MFA enrollment and authentication is enabled by default for My Profile and My Apps access for all users.
Default MFA security means that:
  * The following phishing resistant MFA factors are enabled in the identity domain MFA settings:
    * Mobile app push notification
    * Mobile app passcode
    * Fast ID Online (FIDO)
**Important** : At least one of these phishing resistant factors must be enabled. To review the MFA factors that are enabled in an identity domain, see [Configuring Multifactor Authentication Settings](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/mfa/configure-multi-factor-authentication-settings.htm#configure-multi-factor-authentication-settings "Configure multifactor authentication \(MFA\) settings and compliance policies that define which MFA factors are required to access an identity domain in IAM, and then configure the MFA factors.").
  * Users accessing My Profile and My Apps pages will be challenged for MFA, even if they've already authenticated with MFA during their current session.
  * Any users who aren't enrolled in MFA, will be forced to enroll.

## Changing MFA Factor Settings
Review and change MFA factor settings in the security section of the domain.
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Domains**.
  2. Select the name of the identity domain that you want to work in. You might need to change the compartment to find the domain that you want.
  3. On the domain details page, select **Security** in the leftmost navigation area to access security options.
  4. Select **MFA** under **Security** in the leftmost navigation area to display the MFA settings page.
  5. Set MFA preferences by enabling or disabling MFA factors.


**Remember** : At least one phishing resistant factor must be enabled.
## Disabling Default MFA Access ðŸ”— 
Disabling the default MFA security feature isn't recommended. Oracle support must disable it for you. See [Support Requests](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/GSG/Tasks/contactingsupport.htm) to contact Oracle support.
