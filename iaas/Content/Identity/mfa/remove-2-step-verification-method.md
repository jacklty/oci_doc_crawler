# Updating or Removing a 2–step Verification Factor
Use the **2–step verification** section of the **Security** tab in the **My profile** console to remove a verification factor from your account.
**Prerequisite:**
Enable 2-step verification. Users usually enable 2-step verification automatically when they first sign in. However, if your administrator made 2-step verification optional, and you have selected **Skip** each time you sign in, you can enable 2-step verification in the **My profile** console, **Security** tab. See [Activating 2-Step Verification](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/mfa/enroll-2-step-verification-first-login.htm#enroll-2-step-verification-first-login "If your administrator made 2-step verification optional, and you have selected Skip each time you sign in, you can enable 2-step verification in the My profile console Security tab.").
**Note**
If account recovery and MFA haven't been enabled by your administrator, you will not see the Security tab. If you have questions about account recovery and MFA for your account, contact your administrator.
If you need help contacting your administrator, see _Contacting Your Administrator_ in the [Contacting Support](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/GSG/Tasks/signinginIdentityDomain.htm#contacting_support) section.
  1. In the navigation bar, select the **Profile** menu and then select **User settings** or **My profile** , depending on the option that you see. In the **My profile** console, select **Security**.
  2. In the **2-Step verification** section for the factor that you want to remove, select the Actions menu (![Actions Menu](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/libraries/global-images/actions-menu.png)).
    1. Select **Edit** to edit the factor.
    2. Select **Remove** to remove the factor.
**Note** You can't remove all the factors. If you have only one factor configured, an error message appears at the top of the page when you confirm the removal.
