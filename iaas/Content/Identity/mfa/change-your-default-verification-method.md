# Changing Your Default Verification Factor
If you are enrolled in more than one factor, you can specify which verification factor is the default. 
**Prerequisite:**
Enable 2-step verification. Users usually enable 2-step verification automatically when they first sign in. However, if your administrator made 2-step verification optional, and you have selected **Skip** each time you sign in, you can enable 2-step verification in the **My profile** console, **Security** tab. See [Activating 2-Step Verification](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/mfa/enroll-2-step-verification-first-login.htm#enroll-2-step-verification-first-login "If your administrator made 2-step verification optional, and you have selected Skip each time you sign in, you can enable 2-step verification in the My profile console Security tab.").
**Note**
If account recovery and MFA haven't been enabled by your administrator, you will not see the Security tab. If you have questions about account recovery and MFA for your account, contact your administrator.
If you need help contacting your administrator, see _Contacting Your Administrator_ in the [Contacting Support](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/GSG/Tasks/signinginIdentityDomain.htm#contacting_support) section.
  1. In the navigation bar, select the **Profile** menu and then select **User settings** or **My profile** , depending on the option that you see. In the **My profile** console, select **Security**.
A check mark on the method pane indicates your current default verification method.
  2. In the **2-Step verification** section, select the Actions menu (![Actions Menu](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/libraries/global-images/actions-menu.png)) and select **Change default**.
  3. In the **Change default** dialog box, select the method that you want to use as your default verification method.
**Note** Only those 2â€“step verification factors that you are enrolled in are displayed.

The check mark appears on the method pane that you set as your default.
