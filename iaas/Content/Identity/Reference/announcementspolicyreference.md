# Details for the Announcements Service
This topic covers details for writing policies to control access to the Announcements service.
## Resource-Types ðŸ”— 
  * `announcements`
  * `announcement-subscriptions`


## Supported Variables ðŸ”— 
Announcements supports all the general variables, plus the ones listed here. For more information about general variables supported by Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services, see [General Variables for All Requests](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Reference/policyreference.htm#General).
Variable | Variable Type | Comments  
---|---|---  
`target.announcement-subscription.id` | Entity (OCID) | Use this variable to control access to an announcement subscription based on the OCID of the subscription. (You cannot use this variable when creating a subscription, as the subscription does not exist to have an OCID yet.)  
## Details for Verb + Resource-Type Combinations ðŸ”— 
The following tables show the [permissions](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/policies/permissions.htm) and API operations covered by each verb. The level of access is cumulative as you go from `inspect` > `read` > `use` > `manage`. For example, a group that can use a resource can also inspect and read that resource. A plus sign (+) in a table cell indicates incremental access compared to the cell directly above it, whereas "no extra" indicates no incremental access. 
For example, the `read` verb for the `announcements` resource-type includes the same permissions and API operations as the `inspect` verb, plus the ANNOUNCEMENT_READ permission and an additional API peration, `GetAnnouncement`. However, the `use` verb and `manage` verbs cover no extra permissions or API operations compared to `read`.
