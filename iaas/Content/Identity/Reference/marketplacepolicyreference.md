Details for the Marketplace Service
This topic covers details for writing policies to control access to the Marketplace service.
## Individual Resource-Type ðŸ”— 
`marketplace-listings`
`marketplace-publications`
`marketplace-community-listings`
## Supported Variables ðŸ”— 
Marketplace supports all the general variables, plus the ones listed here. Specifically, you can use the variables listed here when writing policies that grant `read`, `use`, and `manage` verbs. You cannot use them with the `inspect` verb. For more information about general variables supported by Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services, see [General Variables for All Requests](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Reference/policyreference.htm#General).
Resource-Type | Variable | Variable Type | Description  
---|---|---|---  
`marketplace-listings` | `listing.id` | String | Use this variable to control whether to return a specific listing (based on the given listing ID) in response to a request.  
`marketplace-listings` | `listing.publisher.id` | String | Use this variable to control whether to return only listings from a specific publisher (based on the given publisher ID) in response to a request.  
`marketplace-community-listings` | `listing.id` | String  
`marketplace-publications` | `listing.id` | String | Use this variable to control whether to return a specific publication (based on the given listing ID) in response to a request.  
`marketplace-publications` | `listing.type` | String | Use this variable to control whether to return only listings from a specific publisher category (based on the given listing type) in response to a request. A publication's publisher category informs where the listing appears for use.  
`marketplace-publications` | `listing.destination-compartment.id` | String  
`marketplace-publications` | `listing.source-compartment.id` | String  
## Details for Verb + Resource-Type Combinations ðŸ”— 
The following tables show the [permissions](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/policies/permissions.htm) and API operations covered by each verb. The level of access is cumulative as you go from `inspect` > `read` > `use` > `manage`. For example, a group that can use a resource can also inspect and read that resource. A plus sign (+) in a table cell indicates incremental access compared to the cell directly above it, whereas "no extra" indicates no incremental access. 
For example, the `use` verb for the `marketplace-listings` resource-type includes the same permissions and API operations as the `read` verb, plus the MARKETPLACE_LISTING_LAUNCH permission and an additional API operation, `LaunchListing`. However, the `manage` verb covers no extra permissions or API operations compared to `use`.
