For instructions on how to create and manage policies using the Console or API, see [Overview of Working with Policies](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/policymgmt/managingpolicies.htm#overview_policies).
## Verbs ðŸ”— 
The verbs are listed in order of least amount of ability to most. The exact meaning of a each verb depends on which resource-type it's paired with. The tables later in this section show the API operations covered by each combination of verb and resource-type.
Verb | Target User | Types of Access Covered  
---|---|---  
`inspect` | Third-party auditors | Ability to list resources, without access to any confidential information or user-specified metadata that might be part of that resource. **Important:** The operation to list policies includes the contents of the policies themselves. The list operations for the Networking resource-types return all the information (for example, the contents of security lists and route tables).   
`read` | Internal auditors | Includes `inspect` plus the ability to get user-specified metadata and the actual resource itself.   
`use` | Day-to-day end users of resources | Includes `read` plus the ability to work with existing resources (the actions vary by resource type). Includes the ability to update the resource, except for resource-types where the "update" operation has the same effective impact as the "create" operation (for example, `UpdatePolicy`, `UpdateSecurityList`, and more), in which case the "update" ability is available only with the `manage` verb. In general, this verb doesn't include the ability to create or delete that type of resource.  
`manage` | Administrators | Includes all permissions for the resource.

IAM has no family resource-type, only individual ones. See [IAM Policies Overview](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/policieshow/Policy_Basics.htm#top "IAM policies govern control of resources in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure \(OCI\) tenancies.") or [Details for IAM without Identity Domains](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Reference/iampolicyreference.htm#top), depending on whether your tenancy has identity domains or not.
