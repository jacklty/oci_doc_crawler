# Details for the Core Services
This topic covers details for writing policies to control access to the Core Services (Networking, Compute, and Block Volume).
## Resource-Types ðŸ”— 
[Networking](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Reference/corepolicyreference.htm)
#### Aggregate Resource-Type
`virtual-network-family`
`drgs` (covers drg-object, drg-route-table, drg-route-distribution, drg-attachment)
#### Individual Resource-Types
`byoiprange`
`capture-filters`
`cpes`
`cross-connect-groups`
`cross-connects`
`dhcp-options`
`drg-attachments`
`drg-object`
`drg-route-distributions`
`drg-route-tables`
`internet-gateways`
`ipsec-connections`
`ipv6s`
`ipam`
`local-peering-gateways` (which includes `local-peering-from`, and `local-peering-to`) 
`nat-gateways`
`network-security-groups`
`private-ips`
`publicippool`
`public-ips`
`remote-peering-connections` (which includes `remote-peering-from`, and `remote-peering-to`) 
`route-tables`
`security-lists`
`service-gateways`
`subnets`
`vcns`
`virtual-circuits`
`vlans`
`vnic-attachments`
`vnics`
`vtaps`
#### Comments
A policy that uses `<verb> virtual-network-family` is equivalent to writing one with a separate `<verb> <individual resource-type>` statement for each of the individual resource-types.
See the table in [Details for Verb + Resource-Type Combinations](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Reference/corepolicyreference.htm#Core) for details of the API operations covered by each verb, for each individual resource-type included in `virtual-network-family`.
[Compute](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Reference/corepolicyreference.htm)
#### instance-family Aggregate Resource-Type
The `instance-family` aggregate resource-type covers these individual resource-types:
`app-catalog-listing`
`console-histories`
`instances`
`instance-console-connection`
`instance-images`
`volume-attachments` (includes only the permissions required for attaching volumes to instances)
#### compute-management-family Aggregate Resource-Type
The `compute-management-family` aggregate resource-type covers these individual resource-types:
`instance-configurations`
`instance-pools`
`cluster-networks`
#### instance-agent-family Aggregate Resource-Type
The `instance-agent-family` aggregate resource-type covers this individual resource-type:
`instance-agent-plugins`
#### instance-agent-command-family Aggregate Resource-Type
The `instance-agent-command-family` aggregate resource-type covers this individual resource-type:
`instance-agent-commands`
#### Additional Individual Resource-Types
`auto-scaling-configurations`
`compute-capacity-reports`
`compute-capacity-reservations`
`compute-clusters`
`compute-global-image-capability-schema`
`compute-image-capability-schema`
`dedicated-vm-hosts`
`instance-agent-commands`
`work-requests`
#### Comments
A policy that uses `<verb> instance-family` or `<verb> compute-management-family` is equivalent to writing one with a separate `<verb> <individual resource-type>` statement for each of the individual resource-types in the family.
See the table in [Details for Verb + Resource-Type Combinations](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Reference/corepolicyreference.htm#Core) for details of the API operations covered by each verb, for each individual resource-type.
[Block Volume](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Reference/corepolicyreference.htm)
#### Aggregate Resource-Type ðŸ”— 
`volume-family`
#### Individual Resource-Types ðŸ”— 
`volumes`
`volume-attachments`
`volume-backups`
`boot-volume-backups`
`backup-policies`
`backup-policy-assignments`
`volume-groups`
`volume-group-backups`
#### Comments ðŸ”— 
A policy that uses `<verb> volume-family` is equivalent to writing one with a separate `<verb> <individual             resource-type>` statement for each of the individual resource-types.
See the table in [Details for Verb + Resource-Type Combinations](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Reference/corepolicyreference.htm#Core) for details of the API operations covered by each verb, for each individual resource-type included in `volume-family`.
## Supported Variables ðŸ”— 
The Core Services support all the general variables, plus the ones listed here. For more information about general variables supported by Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services, see [General Variables for All Requests](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Reference/policyreference.htm#General).
Variable | Variable Type | Comments  
---|---|---  
`target.boot-volume.kms-key.id` | String | Use this variable to control whether Compute instances can be launched with boot volumes that were created without a Vault service master encryption key.  
`target.image.id` | String | The specific image OCID allowed by the policy.  
## Details for Verb + Resource-Type Combinations ðŸ”— 
The following tables show the [permissions](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/policies/permissions.htm) and API operations covered by each verb. The level of access is cumulative as you go from `inspect` > `read` > `use` > `manage`. For example, a group that can use a resource can also inspect and read that resource. A plus sign (+) in a table cell indicates incremental access compared to the cell directly above it, whereas "no extra" indicates no incremental access. 
For example, the `read` and `use` verbs for the `vcns` resource-type cover no extra permissions or API operations compared to the `inspect` verb. However, the `manage` verb includes several extra permissions and API operations.
### For virtual-network-family Resource Types ðŸ”—

### For instance-family Resource Types ðŸ”— 
The `instance-family` aggregate resource-type includes extra permissions beyond the sum of the permissions for the individual resource-types included in `instance-family`. For example: It includes a few permissions for `vnics` and `volumes`, even though those resource-types aren't generally considered part of the `instance-family`. Why are there extras included? So you can write fewer policy statements to cover general use cases, like working with an instance that has an attached block volume. You can write one statement for `instance-family` instead of multiple statements covering `instances`, `vnics`, and `volumes`. 
Here's a list of the extra permissions:
For `inspect instance-family`:
  * VNIC_READ
  * VNIC_ATTACHMENT_READ
  * VOLUME_ATTACHMENT_INSPECT


For `read instance-family`:
  * VOLUME_ATTACHMENT_READ


For `use instance-family`:
  * VNIC_ATTACH
  * VNIC_DETACH
  * VOLUME_ATTACHMENT_UPDATE


For `manage instance-family`:
  * VOLUME_ATTACHMENT_CREATE
  * VOLUME_ATTACHMENT_DELETE


The following tables list the permissions and API operations covered by each of the individual resource-types included in `instance-family`.
