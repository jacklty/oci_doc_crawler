# Details for the Network Monitoring Service
This topic covers details for writing policies to control access to the Network Monitoring service.
## Resource-Types
**Individual Resource-Types**
`path-analyzer-test`
## For path-analyzer-test Resource Types
The following table lists the permissions and API operations covered by each of the individual resource-types included in this API.
## Supported Variables
This API supports all the general variables (see [General Variables for All Requests](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Reference/policyreference.htm#General)).
## Details for Verb + Resource-Type Combinations
The following tables show the [permissions](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/policies/permissions.htm) and API operations covered by each verb. The level of access is cumulative as you go from `inspect` > `read` > `use` > `manage`. For example, a group that can use a resource can also inspect and read that resource. A plus sign (+) in a table cell indicates incremental access compared to the cell directly above it, whereas "no extra" indicates no incremental access. 
For example, the `read` and `use` verbs for the `path-analyzer-test` resource-type cover no extra permissions or API operations compared to the `inspect` verb. However, the `manage` verb includes several extra permissions and API operations.

Verbs | Permissions | APIs Fully Covered | APIs Partially Covered  
---|---|---|---

read |  INSPECT+ VNPA_READ |  `GetPathAnalysis` `GetPathAnalyzerTest` `GetWorkRequest` |  none

manage |  USE + VNPA_CREATE VNPA_DELETE VNPA_MOVE |  `CreatePathAnalyzerTest` `DeletePathAnalyzerTest` `ChangePathAnalyzerTestCompartment` |  none  
## Permissions Required for Each API Operation ðŸ”— 
The following tables list the API operations grouped by resource type. The resource types are listed in alphabetical order.
For information about permissions, see [Permissions](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/policyadvancedfeatures.htm#Permissi).
