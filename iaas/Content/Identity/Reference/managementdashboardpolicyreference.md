# Details for Management Dashboard
This topic covers details for writing policies to control access to Management Dashboard.
## Resource-Types ðŸ”— 
### Individual Resource-Types ðŸ”— 
`management-dashboard`
`management-saved-search`
### Aggregate Resource-Type ðŸ”— 
`management-dashboard-family`
### Comments ðŸ”— 
A policy that uses `<verb> management-dashboard-family` is equivalent to writing one with a separate `<verb> <individual           resource-type>` statement for each of the individual resource-types. The resource-type `management-dashboard` allows a user group to work with dashboards while the resource-type `management-saved-search` allows a user group to work with saved searches (widgets) that are displayed in dashboards.
See the table in [Details for Verb + Resource-Type Combinations](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Reference/managementdashboardpolicyreference.htm#details) for details of the API operations covered by each verb, for each individual resource-type included in `management-dashboard-family`.
## Supported Variables ðŸ”— 
Only the general variables are supported (see [General Variables for All Requests](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Reference/policyreference.htm#General)).
## Details for Verb + Resource-Type Combinations ðŸ”— 
The following tables show the [permissions](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/policies/permissions.htm) and API operations covered by each verb. The level of access is cumulative as you go from `inspect` > `read` > `use` > `manage`. For example, a group that can use a resource can also inspect and read that resource. A plus sign (+) in a table cell indicates incremental access compared to the cell directly above it, whereas "no extra" indicates no incremental access.

## Example Policies ðŸ”— 
This section provides example policies for use with Management Dashboard.
### Dashboard Policies ðŸ”— 
Here are examples of policy statements that authorize access to dashboards (`management-dashboard` resource-type):
  * To allow a user group to list the dashboards in a compartment, use the `inspect` verb:
```
Allow group dashboard-users to inspect management-dashboard in compartment myCompartment1
```

  * To allow a user group to list dashboards and obtain details regarding the dashboards in a compartment, use the `read` verb:
```
Allow group dashboard-users to read management-dashboard in compartment myCompartment1
```

  * To allow a group of administrators to list dashboards, obtain details regarding dashboards, and update the dashboards in a compartment, use the `use` verb:
```
Allow group dashboard-admins to use management-dashboard in compartment myCompartment1
```

  * To allow a group of administrators to list dashboards, obtain details regarding dashboards, update dashboards, and manage (create, move, and delete) the dashboards in a compartment, use the `manage` verb:
```
Allow group dashboard-admins to manage management-dashboard in compartment myCompartment1
```



### Saved Search Policies ðŸ”— 
Here are examples of policy statements that authorize access to saved searches (`management-saved-search` resource-type):
  * To allow a user group to list the saved searches in a compartment, use the `inspect` verb:
```
Allow group saved-search-users to inspect management-saved-search in compartment myCompartment1
```

  * To allow a user group to list saved searches and obtain details regarding the saved searches in a compartment, use the `read` verb:
```
Allow group saved-search-users to read management-saved-search in compartment myCompartment1
```

  * To allow a group of administrators to list saved searches, obtain details regarding saved searches, update the saved searches in a compartment, use the `use` verb:
```
Allow group saved-search-admins to use management-saved-search in compartment myCompartment1
```

  * To allow a group of administrators to list saved searches, obtain details regarding saved searches, update saved searches, and manage (create, move, and delete) the saved searches in a compartment, use the `manage` verb:
```
Allow group saved-search-admins to manage management-saved-search in compartment myCompartment1
```



### Aggregate Policies ðŸ”— 
Here's an example of a policy that simultaneously authorizes access to both dashboards and saved searches by using the aggregate `management-dashboard-family` resource-type. In this example, the `inspect` verb is used to allow a user group to list both the dashboards and saved searches in a compartment:
```
Allow group dashboard-family-admins to inspect management-dashboard-family in compartment myCompartment1
```

Similarly, the other Oracle Cloud Infrastructure verbs can be used to allow user groups to perform the corresponding tasks for dashboards and saved searches in one policy.
