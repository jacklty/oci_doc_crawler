# Details for the Certificates Service
Learn the details about permissions for the Certificates service so you can write policies to control access to its resources.
This topic covers Certificates service details about resource-types you can grant permissions to, special variables you can use when adding conditions to a policy, the hierarchy of permissions and API operations covered by each verb for each resource-type, and the permissions for each API operation.
## Individual Resource-Types ðŸ”— 
Individual resource-types let you write policy statements scoped to a specific resource-type and no others.
`leaf-certificates`
`leaf-certificate-versions`
`leaf-certificate-bundles`
`certificate-authorities`
`certificate-authority-versions`
`certificate-authority-bundles`
`certificate-authority-delegates`
`cabundles`
`certificate-associations`
`certificate-authority-associations`
`cabundle-associations`
## Aggregate Resource-Types ðŸ”— 
Aggregate resource-types let you write policy statements with a scope that extends beyond an individual resource-type to all resource-types covered by the aggregate resource-type.
`leaf-certificate-family`
`certificate-authority-family`
A policy that uses `<verb> leaf-certificate-family` is equivalent to writing one with a separate `<verb> <individual         resource-type>` statement for each of the following individual certificate resource-types: `leaf-certificates`, `leaf-certificate-versions`, `leaf-certificate-bundles`, `cabundles`, `certificate-associations`, and `cabundle-associations`.
A policy that uses `<verb> certificate-authority-family` is equivalent to writing one with a separate `<verb> <individual         resource-type>` statement for each of the following individual certificate authority (CA) and certificate resource-types: `certificate-authorities`, `certificate-authority-versions`, `certificate-authority-bundles`, `certificate-authority-delegates`, `leaf-certificates`, `leaf-certificate-versions`, `leaf-certificate-bundles`, `cabundles`, `certificate-associations`, `certificate-authority-associations`, and `cabundle-associations`.
See the table in [Details for Verb + Resource-Type Combinations](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Reference/keypolicyreference.htm#Details) for details of the API operations covered by each verb, for each individual resource-type included in `leaf-certificate-family` and `certificate-authority-family`.
## Supported Variables ðŸ”— 
Certificates supports all the general variables, plus the ones listed here.

## Details for Verb + Resource-Type Combinations ðŸ”— 
Understand the incremental access granted by each verb for each resource-type so you can write policies that grant only the access required and nothing more.
The following tables show the [permissions](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/policyadvancedfeatures.htm#Permissi) and API operations covered by each verb. The level of access is cumulative as you go from `inspect` > `read` > `use` > `manage`. A plus sign (+) in a table cell indicates incremental access compared to the cell directly above it, whereas "no extra" indicates no incremental access.
For example, the `use` verb for the `cabundles` resource-type includes the same permissions and API operations as the `read` verb, plus the CABUNDLE_UPDATE permission and the `UpdateCaBundle` API operation. The `manage` verb allows even more permissions and API operations when compared to the `use` verb.
