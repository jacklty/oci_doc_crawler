# Set Permissions for Your Microsoft Active Directory Account
Set permissions for your Microsoft Active Directory domain administrator account before you create a bridge between IAM and Microsoft Active Directory.
You must set these permissions so that you can install the bridge and configure delegated authentication for it.
With delegated authentication, identity domain administrators and security administrators don't have to synchronize user passwords between Microsoft Active Directory and IAM. Users can use their Microsoft Active Directory passwords to sign in to IAM to access resources and applications protected by IAM.
