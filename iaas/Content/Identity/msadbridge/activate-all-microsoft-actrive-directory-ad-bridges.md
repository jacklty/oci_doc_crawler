# Activating All AD Bridges
Activate all AD bridges in an IAM identity domain at the same time.
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Domains**.
  2. Click the name of the identity domain that you want to work in. You might need to change the compartment to find the domain that you want. Then, click **Settings** and then **Directory integration**.
  3. Select **Activate All**.
  4. In the **Confirmation** window, select **OK**.
By activating all domains, you're activating the AD bridge associated with each domain. The status of each bridge changes from **Inactive** to **Active**.
