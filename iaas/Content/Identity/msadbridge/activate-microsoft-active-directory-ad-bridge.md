# Activating an AD Bridge
Activate a single AD bridge in an IAM identity domain.
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Domains**.
  2. Click the name of the identity domain that you want to work in. You might need to change the compartment to find the domain that you want. Then, click **Settings** and then **Directory integration**.
  3. Select the Actions menu (![Actions Menu](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/libraries/global-images/actions-menu.png)) for the domain that contains the AD bridge that you want to activate and select **Activate**.
  4. In the **Confirmation** window, select **OK**.
By activating the domain, you're activating the AD bridge associated with the domain. The status of the bridge changes from **Inactive** to **Active**.
