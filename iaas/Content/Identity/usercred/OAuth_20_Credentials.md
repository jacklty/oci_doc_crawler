# OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials
Use OAuth 2.0 client credential to interact programmatically with services that use the OAuth 2.0 authorization protocol.
**Note** OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials are not available in the United Kingdom Government Cloud (OC4).
OAuth 2.0 client credentials are required to interact programmatically with those services that use the OAuth 2.0 authorization protocol. The credentials enable you to obtain a secure token to access those service REST API endpoints. The allowed actions and endpoints granted by the token depend on the scopes (permissions) that you select when you generate the credentials. For more information, see [Working With OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/access/working-with-oauth-20-client-credentials.htm#oauth "OAuth 2.0 client credentials are required to interact programmatically with those services that use the OAuth 2.0 authorization protocol.").
