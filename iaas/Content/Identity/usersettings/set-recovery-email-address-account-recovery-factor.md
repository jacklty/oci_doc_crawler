# Changing Your Account Recovery Email
Set up an email other than your primary email as a factor for password recovery.
By default, your _primary email address_ has been set as the email address that IAM uses to help you recover your account. If you have to regain access, then IAM sends a notification to this email address. You follow the instructions in the notification to recover your account. 
If you want to use another email address instead of your _primary email address_ , you can specify an alternate (recovery) email address using the following instructions.
  1. In the navigation bar, select the **Profile** menu and then select **User settings** or **My profile** , depending on the option that you see. In the **My profile** console, select **Security**.
  2. In the **Account recovery options** pane, go to **Recovery email** , and select the **Actions** menu.
  3. Select **Edit**.
  4. In the **Change recovery email** dialog box, enter your password for security purposes, and then select **Verify**.
  5. In the **New recovery email** field, enter a different email address to use to recover your account, and then select **Change recovery email**.
IAM sends a verification notification to this email address. 
**Tip** If you didn't receive the notification, then in the **Recovery options** page, select **Resend email**. IAM resends the notification to the email address you provided in step 5.
  6. In your Inbox, open the verification notification, and then select the **Email verification** link.
  7. In the **Email verified** page, select the **Select here to continue** link.
  8. In the **Recovery email** pane of the **Account recovery options** section, verify that you see the recovery email address that you provided in step 5.
