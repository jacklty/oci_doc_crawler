# Changing Your Password
Passwords are valid only for the period specified by the password policy defined by your administrator. When your password expires, you must update your password to access an identity domain.
  1. In the navigation bar, select the **Profile** menu and then select **User settings** or **My profile** , depending on the option that you see. In the **My profile** console, select **Change password**.
  2. In the **Current password** field, enter your current password.
  3. In the **New password** field, enter a new password.
**Tip**
If you're using your password to sign in, then use the **Password Criteria** pane to confirm that your new password conforms to the password policy set by your administrator.
If you're using your Microsoft Active Directory password to sign in to an identity domain, then your password policy criteria is defined and maintained by your Microsoft Active Directory administrator. Contact your administrator for more information about this criteria.
  4. In the **Confirm new password** field, reenter your new password.
  5. Select **Save**.
     * If your password conforms to the policy, then your password is saved.
     * If your password **doesn't** conform to the policy, then you see an error message explaining the violations. Correct the violations and then select **Save** again.
You receive an email verification that your password was updated correctly.
