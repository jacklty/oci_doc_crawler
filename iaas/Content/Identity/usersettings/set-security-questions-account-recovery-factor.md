# Selecting Security Questions for Account Recovery
You can select and answer security questions, and provide hints for answers to these questions, to verify your identity. If you have to recover your account, then you must answer these questions correctly to regain access.
**Prerequisite:**
Enable 2-step verification. Users usually enable 2-step verification automatically when they first sign in. However, if your administrator made 2-step verification optional, and you have selected **Skip** each time you sign in, you can enable 2-step verification in the **My profile** console, **Security** tab. See [Activating 2-Step Verification](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/mfa/enroll-2-step-verification-first-login.htm#enroll-2-step-verification-first-login "If your administrator made 2-step verification optional, and you have selected Skip each time you sign in, you can enable 2-step verification in the My profile console Security tab.").
**Note**
If account recovery and MFA haven't been enabled by your administrator, you will not see the Security tab. If you have questions about account recovery and MFA for your account, contact your administrator.
If you need help contacting your administrator, see _Contacting Your Administrator_ in the [Contacting Support](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/GSG/Tasks/signinginIdentityDomain.htm#contacting_support) section.
  1. In the navigation bar, select the **Profile** menu and then select **User settings** or **My profile** , depending on the option that you see. In the **My profile** console, select **Security**.
  2. In the **Account recovery options** pane, go to **Security questions**.
  3. Select **Configure**.
**Note** If you don't see **Configure** in this pane, then you have already set security questions as an account recovery factor.
  4. In the **Security questions** dialog box, select your security questions, provide answers and optional answer hints, and then select **Save**.
**Tip** After you provide an answer to a security question, select **Reveal** ![Reveal button](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Resources/Images/reveal.png). Your answer appears in clear text, and you can verify that you entered it correctly.
