# Using Form Fill Applications
Store your application credentials using form fill apps so that you have one select access to the websites you use most. 
For applications where your administrator enables the Oracle Secure Form Fill plugin, collects your credentials the first time you access the app from the **My Apps** page, and then seamlessly logs you in on future accesses.
**Prerequisite:** You must be using a Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox browser.
**Note** Internet Explorer and Edge are not supported.
## Installing the Oracle Form-Fill Plugin ðŸ”— 
Learn when and how to install the plugin that's required to use form fill apps.
When your administrator grants you access to an application that requires the Oracle Form Fill Plugin, you see a prompt to install the plugin the next time you open the **My Apps** page. 
Follow the steps below to install the plugin after you see the prompt in **My Apps**. 
  1. In the navigation bar, select the **Profile** menu and then select **User settings** or **My profile** , depending on the option that you see. In the **My Profile** console, select **More Actions** , and then select **Applications launcher**.
  2. If you see a message at the top of the page that says, "One or more applications granted to you requires the Secure Form Fill Plugin...", proceed with the steps below to install the form fill plugin.
If you don't see the message:
  3. Select **Install Plugin** at top right.
You might need to disable pop-up blocking to proceed.
  4. Follow browser-specific instructions to complete the plugin installation.
     * In Google Chrome, select the **Add to Chrome** button.
     * In Firefox:
       1. Save the plugin file (`stf.xpi`) locally.
       2. In the file system, right-click the file and open it with Firefox.
  5. On the **My Apps** page, refresh the browser window after completing the plugin installation.
  6. Select the icon for an app that requires the form fill plugin.
In the **Enter Credentials** dialog box that opens in front of the **My Apps** page, enter your credentials and select **OK** to proceed to the application's home page.
**Note**
If instead of the **Enter Credentials** dialog box you see the application's login page â€“ the app doesn't support the form fill plugin.


You can now access form fill applications from the **My Apps** page:
  1. The first time you access a form fill application:
    1. Instead of going to the application's login page, an **Enter Credentials** dialog box opens in front of the **My Apps** page.
    2. Enter the login credentials for the application in the **Enter Credentials** dialog box and select **Login**.
The Oracle Form Fill Plugin captures your credentials and logs you in to the application.
  2. When you access the same form fill application from **My Apps** in the future, you are automatically logged in to the application.
**Note**
If you later change your login credentials in the application, you must update your credentials from the application tile on the **My Apps** page.


## Updating Credentials for a Form Fill Application ðŸ”— 
If you change your login credentials with an application that uses the Oracle Form Fill Plugin, you must update your credentials from the My Apps page.
After the first time you access a form fill application from the My Apps page, the Oracle Form Fill Plugin automatically logs you in to that application in the future. But when you change your login credentials within the application, the automatic login using your old credentials fails, and you must manually enter your credentials in the application's login page.
To restore your automatic login through the form fill plugin:
  1. In the navigation bar, select the **Profile** menu and then select **User settings** or **My profile** , depending on the option that you see. In the **My Profile** console, select **More Actions** , and then select **Applications launcher**.
  2. Locate the form fill application for which your credentials have changed.
  3. Select the gear icon in the bottom-right corner of the application's tile and select **Update Credentials**. 
  4. Enter your current login credentials and select **Save**.
