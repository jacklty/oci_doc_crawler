# Deleting Your Account
Only administrators can delete accounts in an identity domain in IAM. If you want your account deleted, contact your administrator. 
If you don't know how to contact your administrator, you can find your administrator's contact information in your original Welcome email.
**Important** Administrators can't delete their own account in an identity domain. See [Support Requests](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/GSG/Tasks/contactingsupport.htm) to contact Oracle support to delete an administrator account in an identity domain.
