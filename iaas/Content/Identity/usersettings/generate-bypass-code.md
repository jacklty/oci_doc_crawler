# Generating a Bypass Code
A bypass code is useful as a second verification factor or for account recovery. You can generate bypass codes after you enroll in 2-Step Verification. And then use that bypass code to access your account when, for example, you don't have your mobile device for verification.
**Prerequisite:**
Enable 2-step verification. Users usually enable 2-step verification automatically when they first sign in. However, if your administrator made 2-step verification optional, and you have selected **Skip** each time you sign in, you can enable 2-step verification in the **My profile** console, **Security** tab. See [Activating 2-Step Verification](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/mfa/enroll-2-step-verification-first-login.htm#enroll-2-step-verification-first-login "If your administrator made 2-step verification optional, and you have selected Skip each time you sign in, you can enable 2-step verification in the My profile console Security tab.").
**Note**
If account recovery and MFA haven't been enabled by your administrator, you will not see the Security tab. If you have questions about account recovery and MFA for your account, contact your administrator.
If you need help contacting your administrator, see _Contacting Your Administrator_ in the [Contacting Support](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/GSG/Tasks/signinginIdentityDomain.htm#contacting_support) section.
  1. In the navigation bar, select the **Profile** menu and then select **User settings** or **My profile** , depending on the option that you see. In the **My profile** console, select **Security**.
  2. In Bypass codes, select **Generate**.
Store your bypass code in a secure location, for example, write it down in a notebook.
If you lose your bypass code, you also have the option to contact an administrator to obtain a bypass code for access.
