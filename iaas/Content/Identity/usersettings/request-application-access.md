# Requesting Application Access
Request access to applications to which you want use. If you don't see the application on the Catalog page, the administrator has not allowed the application to be requested. To make the application accessible, contact your administrator.
  1. In the navigation bar, select the **Profile** menu and then select **User settings** or **My profile** , depending on the option that you see. In the **My profile** console, select **Integrated applications** to request access to an application.
  2. Select **Request access to a new application**.
  3. In the Catalog page, select **Applications**.
  4. Select the plus (+) sign for the application to which you want access.
  5. In the **Add Access** dialog box, enter the reason for the request, and then select **OK**.
Two emails are sent to you. 
     * The first email verifies your request. To go to the **My requests** tab and verify that your request has been submitted, select the **My requests** link in the email.
     * The second email verifies your access. To go to the **My access** tab and verify that your access has been granted, select the **My access** link in the email.
