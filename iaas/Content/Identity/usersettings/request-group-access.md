# Requesting Group Access
Request access to groups to which you want to be a member.
If you don't see the group on the Catalog page, the administrator has not allowed the group to be requested. To make the group accessible, contact your administrator.
  1. In the navigation bar, select the **Profile** menu and then select **User settings** or **My profile** , depending on the option that you see. In the **My profile** console, select **My groups** to request access to a group.
  2. Select **Request access to a new group**.
  3. In the Catalog page, select **Groups**.
  4. Select the plus (+) sign for the group to which you want access.
  5. In the **Add Access** dialog box, enter the reason for the request, and then select **OK**.
Two emails are sent to you. 
     * The first email verifies your request. To go to the **My requests** tab and verify that your request has been submitted, select the **My requests** link in the email.
     * The second email verifies your access. To go to the **My access** tab and verify that your access has been granted, select the **My access** link in the email.
