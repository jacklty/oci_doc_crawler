# Editing Your Primary Email
You can change the primary email address that was set up for you when your account was created.
The _primary email address_ is the email address to which all your notifications are sent. Your administrator has already set your primary email address.
  1. In the navigation bar, select the **Profile** menu and then select **User settings** or **My profile** , depending on the option that you see. In the **My Profile** console, select **More Actions** , and then select **Edit email**.
  2. Select **Change**.
  3. In the **Change primary email** dialog box, enter your password, and then select **Verify**.
  4. In the **New primary email** field, enter a new email address.
  5. Select **Change primary email**.


A verification email is sent to your new email address. To verify your email address, follow the instructions in the email. Also, an update email notification is sent to your old email address.
**Note** In addition to your primary email address, you can set an alternate (recovery) email address that you can use to help you recover your account.
