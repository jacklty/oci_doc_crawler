# Setting Your Mobile Number for Account Recovery
You can provide a mobile number that IAM uses to help you recover your account. This way, if you have to regain access, then IAM sends a one-time passcode in a text message to this mobile number. You enter this passcode to recover your account.
  1. In the navigation bar, select the **Profile** menu and then select **User settings** or **My profile** , depending on the option that you see. In the **My profile** console, select **Security**.
  2. In the **Account recovery options** pane, go to **Mobile number**.
  3. Select **Configure**.
**Note** If you don't see **Configure** , then you have already set your mobile number as an account recovery factor.
  4. In the **Mobile number** field of the **Mobile number** dialog box, select a country code for your mobile number, enter the mobile number to use to recover your account, and then select **Text me**.
IAM sends a passcode in a text message to this mobile number.
**Note** Don't enter any non-numeric characters for your mobile number. For example, if your mobile number is **212-555-1212** , then enter **2125551212**.
  5. After you receive the passcode, enter the passcode in the text field that appears below the **Mobile number** field, and then select **Verify**.
**Note** If you didn't receive the passcode, then select **Resend**. IAM resends the passcode to your mobile number.
