# Updating or Removing an Account Recovery Factor
If you no longer want to use a specific account recovery factor to recover your account, then you can remove it.
**Prerequisite:**
Enable 2-step verification. Users usually enable 2-step verification automatically when they first sign in. However, if your administrator made 2-step verification optional, and you have selected **Skip** each time you sign in, you can enable 2-step verification in the **My profile** console, **Security** tab. See [Activating 2-Step Verification](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/mfa/enroll-2-step-verification-first-login.htm#enroll-2-step-verification-first-login "If your administrator made 2-step verification optional, and you have selected Skip each time you sign in, you can enable 2-step verification in the My profile console Security tab.").
**Note**
If account recovery and MFA haven't been enabled by your administrator, you will not see the Security tab. If you have questions about account recovery and MFA for your account, contact your administrator.
If you need help contacting your administrator, see _Contacting Your Administrator_ in the [Contacting Support](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/GSG/Tasks/signinginIdentityDomain.htm#contacting_support) section.
  1. In the navigation bar, select the **Profile** menu and then select **User settings** or **My profile** , depending on the option that you see. In the **My profile** console, select **Security**.
  2. In the **Account recovery options** pane, go to the account recovery factor that you want to remove, and the select the **Actions** menu.
**Note** If you don't see the **Actions** menu in the pane, then you have not set the account recovery factor.
    1. Select **Edit** to edit the factor.
    2. Select **Remove** to remove the factor.
