# Editing My Profile Details
If you're signing in to an identity domain IAM for the first time, then set up your profile information. If you already set up your profile, then you can modify this information.
  1. In the navigation bar, select the **Profile** menu and then select **User settings** or **My profile** , depending on the option that you see. In the **My profile** console, select **Edit my profile** and update any information, as necessary.
For example, you can change the time zone and language that displays for your account.
  2. (Optional) If you have a multi-valued attribute for your profile, then a **Values** link appears to the right of the attribute. To populate this attribute with values:
    1. Select the **Values** link.
    2. In the pop-up window that appears, select **Add**.
    3. In the text box that appears, enter a value for the attribute.
    4. Repeat steps b and c to add other values for the attribute.
**Tip** To remove an existing value from the attribute, select the **X** button to the right of the value.
    5. Select **OK**. The counter to the right of the **Values** link changes to reflect the updated number of values for the attribute.
  3. Select **Save**.
