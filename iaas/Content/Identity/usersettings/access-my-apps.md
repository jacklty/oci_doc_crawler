# Accessing Your My Apps Page
Use the **My Apps** page to access and organize applications.
Applications that show in the **My Apps** page are applications to which the administrator has granted you access. Access can be granted to you as an individual user or to a group to which you belong. You are directed to the **My Apps** page after you activate your account and each time you sign in thereafter. 
  1. In the navigation bar, select the **Profile** menu and then select **User settings** or **My profile** , depending on the option that you see. In the **My Profile** console, select **More Actions** , and then select **View my apps console**.
  2. Search for applications by entering a string that begins the application name.
  3. Set your favorites.
  4. Sort applications by **Name** and **Recently granted**.
  5. To access an application, select the application tile or the application name to be taken to the home page of the application. Bookmark application homepages so that you can access the applications directly.
