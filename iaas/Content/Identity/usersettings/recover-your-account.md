# Recovering Your Account
If you have trouble signing in, you're locked out of, or you forget your password to an identity domain in IAM, then you can reset your password to recover your account.
There are three factors that you can set to regain access to your account. You can specify an alternate (recovery) email address, provide a mobile number, or select and answer security questions to verify your identity.
  1. On the Oracle Cloud sign in page, confirm that you're signing in to the correct tenancy and correct identity domain and select **Next**.
  2. On the Request Password Change page, confirm your email address or user name and then select **Fogot Password?**.
  3. In the **Forgot Your Password?** page, enter your username, and then select **Next**.
  4. Select the**Recovery email** , **Mobile number** , or **Security questions** account recovery method.
    1. If you select **Recovery email** , then a **Password reset** notification is sent to the recovery email address associated with your account. Follow the instructions in the notification to reset your password. If you don't receive a notification, contact your administrator. If you don't know how to contact your administrator, you can find your administrator's contact information in your original Welcome email.
    2. If you select **Mobile number** , then a passcode is sent to the mobile number associated with your account. Enter the passcode, and then select **Verify** to reset your password.
    3. If you select **Security questions** , then one of the security questions that you set appears. Provide the answer to this security question, and then select **Verify** to reset your password.


**Important**
The factors that are available for you to select are dependent upon the selections you made when you set your account recovery options. For example, if you didn't set your mobile number as an account recovery factor, then you can't use this factor to recover your account. It doesn't appear in the **Forgot Your Password?** page.
If **Recovery email** is the only account recovery method that you set, then you won't be prompted to select a method. Instead, the **Password reset** notification is sent to the recovery email address associated with your account. 
If you haven't set any account recovery options, then the **Password reset** notification is sent to your primary email address. 
If you've attempted to reset your password and haven't received your password reset email, search your spam folder for the name of the cloud account or tenancy. You can also search for "Oracle" or the phrases "Cloud Console," "account recovery," or "reset."
If you can't find the email, contact your administrator. Or, you can contact support. If you need help contacting support, see [Creating a Support Request](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/GSG/support/create-incident.htm).
**Tip** If you need help contacting your administrator, see _Contacting Your Administrator_ in the [Contacting Support](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/GSG/Tasks/signinginIdentityDomain.htm#contacting_support) section.
