# Signing In to an Identity Domain Using an Alternative Login Method
If you have set up more than one 2-step verification method or at least one 2-step verification method and a bypass code, then you can switch to an alternative login method when you can't use your default.
**Before You Begin:**
Set up more than one 2-step verification method. Or, set up one 2-step verification method and generate a bypass code. You can generate your own bypass code after sign in to use as an alternative authenticaton factor or for account recovery. To learn how to set up 2-step verification and generate a bypass code, see [Setting Up Account Recovery and 2-Step Verification](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/usersettings/manage_security_and_2_step_verification.htm#manage_security_and_2_step_verification "Set up and manage account recovery, 2-step verification, and generate bypass codes to ensure that you always have secure access to your account.").
Use an alternative login method when your default method isn't available. For example, if you don't have your phone with you but you do have your bypass code, use the bypass code as an alternative login method to verify your identity. 
To use an alternative login method, complete the following steps: 
  1. Enter your username and password in an environment that uses multifactor authentication.
  2. Select **Show alternative login methods**.
All 2â€“Step Verification methods that you're enrolled in and a bypass code option (if you have set a bypass code) appear in the Alternative login methods section.
  3. Select a different verification method.
  4. Enter the required verification.
  5. Select the **Make this my default method** checkbox to set this 2-Step Verification method as your default. The next time that you log in, you are prompted to verify your identity using this method of verification.
