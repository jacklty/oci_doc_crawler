# Revoking Your Consents
For some applications, you must agree to the terms of use so that you can access them. Also, application resources might require consent so that client applications can access these resources. You can view and revoke your terms of use and application consents.
The **My consents** page of the **My profile** console lists two types of applications:
  * Applications you have agreed to the terms of use.
  * Applications you have consented access to resources.


The **Terms of use consents** section in the **My consents** page of the **My profile** console is associated with consents that you agreed to upon accessing applications protected by IAM.
The **Application consents** section of this page refers to OAuth consents that you allowed applications to access, for resource scopes that require consent.
  1. In the navigation bar, select the **Profile** menu and then select **User settings** or **My profile** , depending on the option that you see. In the **My profile** console, select **My consents**.
The page shows the list of applications that you have agreed to the terms of use, and the list of applications you have allowed consent.
  2. For both the **Terms of use consents** and **Application consents** sections, perform the following:
     * **Open the terms of use consent** : Select one of the application names. The **Terms of use** page opens and displays the statement of the consent that you agreed upon for the application.
     * **Revoke** : Select the checkbox in front of the application name, and then select **Revoke**.
Alternatively, you can select the **Actions** menu option of the application, and then select **Revoke**.
In the **Confirmation** window, select **OK** to confirm you want to revoke the terms of use consent.
