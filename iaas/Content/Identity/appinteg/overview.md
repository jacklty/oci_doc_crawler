# Why Should You Integrate Your Applications?
Integrating your applications makes it easy for users to sign in with single sign on and gives you a central place to manage their permissions. Application integration includes securing your users, protecting the resources within the applications, and enabling users to access your applications through single sign-on (SSO). Integrating your applications with IAM provides the user with a seamless experience. Because of SSO, the user doesn't have to remember different IDs and passwords for each application. When your applications are integrated with IAM, your administrative overhead is reduced greatly because you can manage the policies and users for your applications from one central place. From a compliance perspective, IAM provides you with a single location where you can manage the access that your users have to your applications.
As part of application integration, IAM can be used as either an identity provider or a service provider for applications. An **identity provider** , also known as an Identity Assertion provider, provides identifiers for users who want to interact with IAM using a website that's external to IAM. A **service provider** is a website that hosts applications. You can enable an identity provider and define one or more service providers. Your users can then access the applications hosted by the service providers directly from the identity provider.
For example, a website can allow users to log in to IAM with their Google credentials. Google acts as the identity provider and IAM functions as the service provider. Google verifies that the user is an authorized user and returns information to IAM (for example, the user name and the email address of the user, if the email address differs from the user name).
Some applications may require a user account to exist in their local identity store before the user can sign in to access these applications.
When users aren't created in IAM or imported into IAM from a flat file, they need to be synchronized from an authoritative source, such as an HR application or a corporate LDAP directory. For this scenario, the authoritative source and the application have to be integrated with IAM for provisioning and synchronization purposes.
## Which Integration Method to Use? ðŸ”— 
Use the following flowchart to learn which method to use to integrate your application with IAM.
[![Description in the text](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Resources/Images/app_integration_flowchart.png)](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Resources/Images/app_integration_flowchart.png)
In this flowchart, you learn which method to use to integrate your application with Oracle Identity Cloud Service. Do you want to synchronize users to or from Microsoft Active Directory (AD)? If you do, then use the AD Bridge. If you don't, then do you want to synchronize users from an LDAP such as Oracle Internet Directory? If you do, then use the App Catalog and the Provisioning Bridge. If you don't, then is your application listed in the App Catalog? If it is, then use the App Catalog template to provision or synchronize users. If it isn't, then does your application expose SCIM-based REST APIs to manage users? If it does, then use one of the Generic SCIM Templates to provision or synchronize users. If it doesn't, then develop and deploy a SCIM REST interface for your application and use the SCIM App Template to provision or synchronize users.
The following scenarios will help you understand this flowchart for synchronization and provisioning purposes:
### Scenarios for User Synchronization
One of the following scenarios may apply when synchronizing users and groups from authoritative sources:
_An HR Application as an Authoritative Source_
When a company hires an employee, an HR representative adds that employee's information in the HR application directly. The HR application contains information about the user, such as the user's first name, last name, job role, and job location. This information is used to create an account for the user and assign applications to the user. For this scenario, you want to synchronize your user account into IAM from the HR application.
IAM supports integration with the HR application by using the App Catalog. If your application isn't listed in the App Catalog, then you can build your own connector or use the Generic SCIM App Template. This template facilitates the configuration of your custom application when the SCIM APIs are exposed. If your application doesn't expose the SCIM APIs, then you can develop a custom SCIM gateway to act as an interface between IAM and your application.
_A Corporate LDAP as an Authoritative Source_
Some customers store users and groups into an LDAP, such as Microsoft Active Directory (AD) or Oracle Internet Directory. These users and groups can authenticate into IAM by using SSO. For this to occur, first, the users and groups must be synchronized from the LDAP into IAM. To do this, use the Microsoft Active Directory Bridge (for AD) or the Provisioning Bridge (for Oracle Internet Directory).
### Scenario for User Provisioning
IAM enables you to use app templates to provision users to applications. In the App Catalog, you'll find a list of app templates that support provisioning. These templates enable you to integrate these applications with IAM quickly. If your application isn't listed in the App Catalog, then use the Generic SCIM App Template.
Now that you know how to use the flowchart to select a method to integrate your application with IAM for provisioning and synchronization purposes, let's learn about each integration type in greater detail.

## Use Bridges to Integrate IAM with On-Premises Applications ðŸ”— 
This section provides answers to the following questions to help you understand how to use bridges to integrate IAM with on-premises applications, including Microsoft Active Directory (AD), an enterprise LDAP (such as Oracle Internet Directory), and a business application (such as Oracle E-Business Suite) that's used to manage and automate your business-related processes:
### Topics:
  * [Why Use Bridges to Integrate IAM with On-Premises Applications?](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/appinteg/overview.htm#why-bridges "Most customers have Microsoft Active Directory \(AD\) as their central directory service. These customers also use AD as their network directory. This directory is where all of their workstations are connected to and where they manage their users.")
  * [What Are the Types of On-Premises Application Integrations?](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/appinteg/overview.htm#on-premises "By using IAM, customers can control when they will migrate their directory-based applications to the cloud. In the interim, they can use one of the following:")


### Why Use Bridges to Integrate IAM with On-Premises Applications? ðŸ”— 
Most customers have Microsoft Active Directory (AD) as their central directory service. These customers also use AD as their network directory. This directory is where all of their workstations are connected to and where they manage their users.
In addition to AD, customers use:
  * An enterprise LDAP to centralize all of their user identities. So, a customer uses AD to manage their employees, but in the centralized LDAP, the customer manages their partners, consumers, and any other users with which the customer has relationships.
  * Business applications to manage and automate processes across their enterprise. These processes include customer relationship management (CRM), enterprise resource planning (ERP), and supply chain management (SCM) processes.


For these reasons, it's imperative that IAM can integrate with AD, an enterprise LDAP (for example, Oracle Internet Directory), and an on-premises business application (such as Oracle E-Business Suite) to manage and automate the customer's CRM, ERP, SCM, and other business-related processes.
### What Are the Types of On-Premises Application Integrations? ðŸ”— 
By using IAM, customers can control when they will migrate their directory-based applications to the cloud. In the interim, they can use one of the following:
  * AD Bridge: This bridge provides a link between your AD enterprise directory structure and IAM. IAM can synchronize with this directory structure so that any new, updated, or deleted user or group records are transferred into IAM. Each minute, the bridge polls AD for any changes to these records and brings these changes into IAM. So, if a user is deleted in AD, then this change will be propagated into IAM. Because of this synchronization, the state of each record is synchronized between AD and IAM. After the user is synchronized from Microsoft Active Directory to IAM, if you activate or deactivate a user, modify the user's attribute values, or change the group memberships for the user in IAM, then these changes are propagated to Microsoft Active Directory through the AD Bridge. See [Setting Up a Microsoft Active Directory (AD) Bridge](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/msadbridge/microsoft-active-directory-ad-bridge1.htm#microsoft-active-directory-ad-bridge1 "The Microsoft Active Directory \(AD\) bridge provides a link between a Microsoft Active Directory enterprise directory structure and IAM.").
  * Provisioning Bridge: This bridge provides a link between your enterprise LDAP or on-premises business application (such as Oracle Internet Directory or Oracle E-Business Suite) and IAM. Through synchronization, account data that's created and updated directly on the LDAP or business application is pulled into IAM and stored for the corresponding IAM users and groups. Any changes to these records will be transferred into IAM. Because of this, the state of each record is synchronized between the LDAP or business application and IAM.
After users are synchronized from the on-premises business application to IAM, you can also use the Provisioning Bridge to provision users to the application. Provisioning allows you to use IAM to manage the lifecycle of users in the application. This includes creating, modifying, deactivating, activating, and removing users and their profiles across the application. Any changes that you make to users or their profiles in IAM are propagated to the business application through the Provisioning Bridge. See [Managing Provisioning Bridges](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/provisioningbridges/managing-provisioning-bridge.htm#understand-provisioning-bridge "The provisioning bridge provides a link between your on-premises apps and IAM. Through synchronization, account data that's created and updated directly on the apps is pulled into an identity domain and stored for the corresponding identity domain users and groups. As a result, any changes to these records are transferred into an identity domain. So, if a user is deleted in one of your apps, then this change is propagated into the identity domain. Because of this, the state of each record is synchronized between your apps and the identity domain.").
