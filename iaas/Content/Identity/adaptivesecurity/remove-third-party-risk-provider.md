# Deleting a Third-Party Risk Provider
Delete a third-party risk provider that's no longer needed to provide user risk scores in an identity domain in IAM.
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Domains**. 
  2. Click the name of the identity domain that you want to work in. You might need to change the compartment to find the domain that you want. Then, click **Security** and then **Adaptive security**.
  3. In the **Adaptive Security** page, if the risk provider that you want to remove is activated, deactivate it. To learn how to deactivate a risk provider, see [Deactivating a Risk Provider](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/adaptivesecurity/deactivate-risk-provider.htm#deactivate-risk-provider "Deactivate a risk provider for an identity domain in IAM to stop collecting user risk scores.").
  4. Under **Risk providers** , select the Actions menu of the risk provider that you want to delete.
  5. Select **Delete risk provider**.
  6. Confirm the deletion.
