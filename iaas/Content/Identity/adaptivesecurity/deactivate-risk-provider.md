# Deactivating a Risk Provider
Deactivate a risk provider for an identity domain in IAM to stop collecting user risk scores.
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Domains**. 
  2. Click the name of the identity domain that you want to work in. You might need to change the compartment to find the domain that you want. Then, click **Security** and then **Adaptive security**.
  3. Under **Risk providers** , select the Actions menu of the risk provider that you want to deactivate.
**Note**
     * If the default risk provider is deactivated, none of the events configured in this risk provider are used for the user's risk score analysis.
     * If third-party risk providers are deactivated, risk scores aren't retrieved from these risk providers.
  4. Select **Deactivate risk provider**.
  5. Confirm the deactivation.
