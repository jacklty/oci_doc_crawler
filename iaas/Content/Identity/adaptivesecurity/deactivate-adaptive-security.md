# Deactivating Adaptive Security
Deactivate adaptive security for an identity domain in IAM to stop performing contextual and threat event analysis, and stop obtaining user risk scores from third-party risk providers.
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Domains**. 
  2. Click the name of the identity domain that you want to work in. You might need to change the compartment to find the domain that you want. Then, click **Security** and then **Adaptive security**.
  3. In the **Adaptive security** page, turn off **Adaptive intelligence**.
