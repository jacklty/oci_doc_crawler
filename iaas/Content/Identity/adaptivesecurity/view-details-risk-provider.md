# Viewing a Risk Provider's Details
View details, such as the name, company, and activation status, of each risk provider in an identity domain in IAM. You can also see other information, such as the risk levels and authentication information associated with the risk provider.
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Domains**. 
  2. Click the name of the identity domain that you want to work in. You might need to change the compartment to find the domain that you want. Then, click **Security** and then **Adaptive security**.
  3. Select the Actions menu in the **Default risk provider** row and then **Edit risk provider**.
The risk provider details and risk ranges are displayed. To learn about risk ranges, see [Creating a Third-Party Risk Provider](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/adaptivesecurity/add-third-party-risk-provider.htm#add-third-party-risk-provider "Create a risk provider for an identity domain in IAM that you can use to obtain a user's risk score from the Symantec third-party risk engine.").
**Note** If you select the default risk provider, you see a third section: Events. To learn more about events, see [Updating the Default Risk Provider](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/adaptivesecurity/configure-default-risk-provider.htm#configure-default-risk-provider "Update the default risk provider for an identity domain in IAM.").
