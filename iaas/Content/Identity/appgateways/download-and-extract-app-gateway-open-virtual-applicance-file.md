# Downloading and Extracting the App Gateway Binary File
The app gateway binary file you download from the IAM Console is a compressed (.zip) file. This file contains an Open Virtual Appliance (.ova) file which you use to install the App Gateway server.
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Domains**.
  2. Click the name of the identity domain that you want to work in. You might need to change the compartment to find the domain that you want. Then, click **Settings** and then **Downloads**.
  3. In the **Downloads** page, select **Download** for **App Gateway for Identity Cloud Service**.
  4. Save zip file to a local location, and extract the content of the zip file you downloaded to a location on your desktop. For example, `c:\temp`.
The `c:\temp\app-gateway-<version>.ova` file is created .


**Note**
The **App Gateway for Identity Cloud Service** doesn't replace the **App Gate for Identity Cloud Service**. The **App Gateway for Identity Cloud Service** software is based on NGINX web server and is used to protect access of enterprise applications. The **App Gate for Identity Cloud Service** software is an OEM product that has similar but not the same features.
