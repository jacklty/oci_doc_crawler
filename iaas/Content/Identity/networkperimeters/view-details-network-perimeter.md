# Getting a Network Perimeter's Details
View the name and the IP addresses for a network perimeter in an identity domain in IAM.
  1. On the **Network perimeters** list page, find the network perimeter for which you want to see more information. If you need help finding the list page, see [Listing Network Perimeters](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/networkperimeters/listing_network_perimeters.htm#listing_network_perimeters "Retrieve a list of network perimeters.").
  2. From the the Actions menu (![Actions Menu](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/libraries/global-images/actions-menu.png)) of the network perimeter, select **Edit network perimeter**
A window opens and displays the name and IP addresses associated with the network perimeter. You can update these values as needed.
