#  IAM with Identity Domains
Identity and Access Management (IAM) uses identity domains to provide identity and access management features such as authentication, single sign-on (SSO), and identity lifecycle management for Oracle Cloud as well as for Oracle and non-Oracle applications, whether SaaS, cloud hosted, or on premises.
