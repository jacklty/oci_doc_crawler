# Replicating an Infrastructure Region
Replicating an infrastructure region in IAM.
Replicate a region to 
  1. View IAM resources, such as policies or compartments.
  2. View domain resources, such as applications, users, or groups.
**Note** You can't create, edit, or remove any resources while the home region isn't available.


  1. Open the Console, open the **Region** menu, and then select **Manage regions**. The list of regions available to your tenancy is displayed. Your home region is labeled.
  2. Find the region you want to subscribe to and select **Enable replication**.
  3. Select **Close** when you're done selecting replication regions.
  4. To switch to the new region, use the **Region** menu in the Console. See [Switching Regions](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/GSG/Concepts/working-with-regions.htm#Switchin) for more information.
