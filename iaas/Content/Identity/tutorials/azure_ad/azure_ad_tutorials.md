# OCI IAM with Microsoft Entra ID Tutorials 
This set of tutorials provides step-by-step instructions to get you working with Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) and OCI IAM.
A common requirement for OCI customers is to enable Single-Sign-On (SSO) between multiple cloud providers. Cloud administrators and application users don't want to have to re authenticate as they move from one cloud platform to another which is something they might do multiple times throughout a typical day. You can read more about this in the blog post [Managing Identity across OCI IAM and Entra ID](https://blogs.oracle.com/cloudsecurity/post/managing-identity-across-oci-iam-and-azure-ad).
These tutorials cover the details of how to enable Single Sign On (SSO) between OCI IAM and Microsoft Entra ID. To enable a fully seamless experience, we also cover configuration of identity Lifecycle Management (LCM) which includes provisioning and deprovisioning of accounts, as well as Just-In-Time (JIT) provisioning using SAML.
Be sure to read the _Before You Begin_ sections in each tutorial so that you have everything you need to complete them successfully. You can perform the tutorials in any order.
  * [SSO Between OCI and Microsoft Entra ID](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/tutorials/azure_ad/sso_azure/azure_sso.htm#azure-sso "In this tutorial, configure SSO between the OCI IAM and Microsoft Entra ID, using Entra ID as the identity provider \(IdP\).")

  * [JIT Provisioning from Entra ID to OCI IAM](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/tutorials/azure_ad/jit_azure/azure_jit.htm#jit-get-started "In this tutorial, you configure Just-In-Time \(JIT\) Provisioning between between the OCI Console and Entra ID, using Entra ID as the IdP.")
