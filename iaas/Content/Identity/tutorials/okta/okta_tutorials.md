# OCI IAM with Okta Tutorials 
This set of tutorials provides step-by-step instructions to get you working with Okta and OCI IAM.
A common requirement for OCI customers is to enable Single-Sign-On (SSO) between multiple cloud providers. Cloud administrators and application users don't want to have to re-authenticate as they move from one cloud platform to another which is something they may do multiple times throughout a typical day.
These tutorials cover the details on how to enable Single Sign On (SSO) between OCI IAM and Okta. To enable a fully seamless experience, these tutorials also cover configuration of identity Lifecycle Management (LCM) which includes provisioning and deprovisioning of accounts using SCIM APIs, as well as Just-In-Time (JIT) provisioning using SAML.
Be sure to read the _Before You Begin_ sections in each tutorial so that you have everything you need to complete them successfully. You can perform the tutorials in any order.
