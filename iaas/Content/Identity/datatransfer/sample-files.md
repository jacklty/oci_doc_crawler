# Sample Import Files
To assist you when importing data, Oracle provides sample import files for you to use. You can download the compressed sample files in the identity domain console or from a link provided by Oracle. Whether you download the sample files from the identity domain console or from a link provided by Oracle, the sample files are the same.
To create an import file, you can use a standard spreadsheet application, such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, or you can use a text editor, such as Notepad or TextPad. To download the sample files, select the [Download sample file](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Resources/Assets/bulkImportSampleFilesCSV.zip) link.
**Important**
If you're using the sample file to import application role memberships, then ensure that the column headings are **Entitlement Value** , **Grantee Name** , and **Grantee Type** (instead of **Display Name** , **Member** , and **Member Type**). If the column headers aren't correct, then change them accordingly. 
**Tip** First import the appropriate sample file with the sample data to familiarize yourself with the process. When you're comfortable with the process, delete the sample data, and then import live data.
