# Transferring Data
Import and export users, groups, and Oracle application roles into and out of an identity domain. 
Learn how to import and export large amounts of data into an identity domain using the user interface. Import data to help you bulk load users, groups, and Oracle application roles. Export data, make changes, and then import those changes back into an identity domain.
## Required Policy or Role ðŸ”— 
To transfer data, you must have one of the following access grants:
  * Be a member of the Administrators group
  * Be granted the Identity Domain Administrator role or the User Administrator role
  * Be a member of a group granted `manage` domains


To understand more about policies and roles, see [The Administrators Group, Policy, and Administrator Roles](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/getstarted/identity-domains.htm#The), [Understanding Administrator Roles](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/roles/understand-administrator-roles.htm#understand-administrator-roles "Learn about administrator roles and the privileges associated with each role so that you can delegate administrative tasks to other users, as needed."), and [IAM Policies Overview](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/policieshow/Policy_Basics.htm#top "IAM policies govern control of resources in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure \(OCI\) tenancies.").
**Before you begin:** Learn about file specifications, column headers, and the sample files.
  * [Import File Specifications](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/datatransfer/import-file-specifications.htm#bulk-loading-file-specifications "Learn about import file specifications to reduce the possibility of errors.")
  * [Column Header User Attributes](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/datatransfer/list-user-attributes-csv-column-headers.htm#list-user-attributes-csv-column-headers "Use these user attributes as column headers while importing or exporting user accounts using a comma-separated values \(CSV\) file.")
  * [Sample Import Files](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/datatransfer/sample-files.htm#sample-files "To assist you when importing data, Oracle provides sample import files for you to use. You can download the compressed sample files in the identity domain console or from a link provided by Oracle. Whether you download the sample files from the identity domain console or from a link provided by Oracle, the sample files are the same.")


Learn how to import users, groups, and Oracle application roles.
  * [Importing Users](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/datatransfer/import-users.htm#import-user-accounts "Import users using a comma-separated values \(CSV\) file.")
  * [Importing Groups](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/datatransfer/import-groups.htm#import-groups "Import groups using a comma-separated values \(CSV\) file.")
  * [Importing Users and Groups for Oracle Application Roles](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/datatransfer/import-users-and-groups-oracle-application-roles.htm#import-users-and-groups-oracle-application-roles "You can import users and groups using a comma-separated value \(CSV\) file and assign them to Oracle application roles.")


Learn how to export users, groups, and Oracle application roles. And then download the exported files.
  * [Exporting Users](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/datatransfer/export-users.htm#export-user-accounts "Export users to a comma-separated values \(CSV\) file.")
  * [Exporting Groups](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/datatransfer/export-groups.htm#export-groups "Export groups to a comma-separated values \(CSV\) file.")
  * [Exporting Users and Groups for Oracle Application Roles](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/datatransfer/export-users-and-groups-oracle-application-roles.htm#export-users-and-groups-oracle-application-roles "Export users and groups assigned to Oracle application roles of Oracle applications to a comma-separated values \(CSV\) file.")
  * [Downloading Exported Files](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/datatransfer/download-exported-files.htm#download-exported-files "After you export files from an identity domain, you must download the files, for example, if you want to import them to another identity domain.")
