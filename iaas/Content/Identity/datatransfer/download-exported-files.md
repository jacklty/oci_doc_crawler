# Downloading Exported Files
After you export files from an identity domain, you must download the files, for example, if you want to import them to another identity domain.
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Domains**. Click the name of the identity domain that you want to work in. You might need to change the compartment to find the domain that you want. Then, click **Jobs**.
  2. Locate and select the specific job for which you want to export the file.
  3. Select **Download exported file**.
A comma-separated value (CSV) file downloads to your local machine. The CSV file contains a record for each error that includes the error type and the error description.
