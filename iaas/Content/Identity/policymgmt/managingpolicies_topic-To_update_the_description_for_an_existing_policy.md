# Updating a Policy's Description
Update the description for an IAM policy.
**Note**
If you use the name of a group, dynamic group, or compartment in a policy, the policy is mapped to the OCID of the group, dynamic group, or compartment when the policy is created. If the OCID of the group, dynamic group, or compartment changes, you must recompile one of the policies that applies to the group or compartment to update the OCID in all the policies. 
To recompile the policy, open a policy, and make a small edit. Save the policy.
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Policies**.
A list of the policies in the compartment you're viewing is displayed. If you don't see the one you're looking for, verify that you're viewing the correct compartment (select from the list on the left side of the page).
  2. Select the name of the policy to show its details.
  3. Select **Edit Policy**.
  4. Edit the description, and then select **Save**.
