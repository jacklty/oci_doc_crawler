# Managing Domain Settings
Domain settings are applied to this identity domain in the Cloud. You can specify settings such as the time zone, password recovery email, and language.
  * [Changing Locale Settings](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/defaultsettings/change-locale-settings.htm#change-default-settings "Change the identity domainâ€“level default settings for time zone and language in IAM. Users can override the default settings in the My Profile Details tab in the My Profile console.")

  * [Getting the Root CA Certificate](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/defaultsettings/obtain-root-ca-certificate.htm#obtain-root-ca-certificate "When you set up service providers and identity providers for federated SSO in an identity domain in IAM, you need to download the metadata file and the signing and encryption certificates. However, these certificates are not self-signed and are issued by a root certificate. So, for a proper setup and function, you need to get the root certificate and install it at the federation partner.")
  * [Setting Contact Email Addresses](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/defaultsettings/set-contact-email.htm#change-default-settings "Set the email addresses to appear in email notifications from an identity domain in IAM.")

You can manually and immediately purge the audit data of that deleted user.")
  * [Requiring User's Email Address for Account Creation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/defaultsettings/set-primary-email-user.htm#change-default-settings "Set whether a primary email address is required to create user accounts in an identity domain in IAM.")
