# Setting Session Limits
Set the duration for which a user's session is valid IAM.
  1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity** , select **Domains**.
  2. Select the name of the identity domain that you want to work in. You might need to change the compartment to find the domain that you want.
  3. On the domain details page, select **Settings**.
  4. On the **Settings** page, select **Session settings**.
  5. To set the duration for which the user's session is valid, enter a value between 1 and 32,767 in **Session duration (in minutes)**. The user's session times out after the session duration has been reached regardless of actual user activity or inactivity.
  6. To set the duration after which a user is automatically signed out of the My Apps console of this identity domain because of inactivity, enter a value between 5 and 480 in **My Apps idle timeout (in minutes)**.
Set the Oracle Cloud Console timeout in the Profile menu. See [Changing the Session Time-Out](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/GSG/Concepts/console_topic-session-timeout.htm).
  7. Select **Save changes**.
