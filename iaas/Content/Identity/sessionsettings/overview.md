# Managing Session Settings
Define session expiration, the sign-in, sign-out, and error URLs, and configure Allow Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow client applications that run on one domain to obtain data from another domain.
## Required Policy or Role ðŸ”— 
To change session settings, you must have one of the following access grants:
  * Be a member of the Administrators group
  * Be granted the Identity Domain Administrator role or the Security Administrator role
  * Be a member of a group granted `manage` domains
