  4. On the **Settings** page, select **Schema management**.
  5. Select **User attributes**.
  6. In the **Filter attribute** field, select **Custom**. 
  7. Select the Actions menu (![Actions Menu](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/libraries/global-images/actions-menu.png))for the custom attribute that you want to remove. Then select **Remove**.
**Note** If data exists for the attribute, you can't remove it.
