# Customizing Schemas
Learn how to add, edit, or remove custom schema attributes and change user permissions for out-of-the-box (base) schema attributes.
## Required Policy or Role ðŸ”— 
To customize schemas, you must have one of the following access grants:
  * Be a member of the Administrators group
  * Be granted the Identity Domain Administrator role or the Security Administrator role
  * Be a member of a group granted `manage` domains


To understand more about policies and roles, see [The Administrators Group, Policy, and Administrator Roles](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/getstarted/identity-domains.htm#The), [Understanding Administrator Roles](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/roles/understand-administrator-roles.htm#understand-administrator-roles "Learn about administrator roles and the privileges associated with each role so that you can delegate administrative tasks to other users, as needed."), and [IAM Policies Overview](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/policieshow/Policy_Basics.htm#top "IAM policies govern control of resources in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure \(OCI\) tenancies.").
You can perform the following schema management tasks:
  * [Creating a Custom Schema Attribute](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/schemas/add-custom-schema-attributes.htm#add-custom-schema-attributes "If you're creating your own user interface for IAM and you don't find a schema attribute that you need from the list of base schema attributes, create one and extend it to the existing schema.")
  * [Deleting a Custom Schema Attribute](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/schemas/remove-custom-schema-attribute.htm#remove-custom-schema-attribute "Remove a custom attribute for the user schema in IAM when you no longer need it.")
  * [Editing a Custom Schema Attribute](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/schemas/edit-custom-schema-attributes.htm#edit-custom-schema-attributes "After you create a custom attribute for the user schema for IAM, you might need to change its settings. For example, you might need to adjust the description or the minimum and maximum length.")
  * [Editing a User's Permission for a Base Schema Attribute](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/schemas/change-user-permissions-base-schema-attribute.htm#change-user-permissions-base-schema-attribute "In addition to creating, editing, or deleting custom schema attributes for the user schema in IAM, you might want to change permissions for a attribute for this schema.")
