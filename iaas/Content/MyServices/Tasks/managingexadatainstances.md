# Managing Exadata Instances
**Important** The My Services dashboard and APIs are deprecated. 
The following procedures walk you through creating, modifying, and deleting Exadata instances used with the [Oracle Cloud My Services API](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/itas/latest/).
**Important** These procedures are for use with Oracle Database Exadata Database Service on Cloud@Customer **ONLY**. For more information, see [Administering Oracle Database Exadata Cloud at Customer](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/cloud-at-customer/exadata-cloud-at-customer/exacc/get-started-this-service.html). These procedures **DO NOT** apply to the Exadata Cloud Service available in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
## Prerequisites ðŸ”— 
Before you can manage Exadata instances, you need to: 
  * Subscribe to an Oracle Cloud service 
  * Obtain account credentials with required roles assigned
  * Determine your API endpoint


[To subscribe to an Oracle Cloud service](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/MyServices/Tasks/managingexadatainstances.htm)
To access [Oracle Cloud My Services API](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/itas/latest/), you must request a trial or paid subscription to an Oracle Cloud service. 
[To obtain account credentials and role assignments](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/MyServices/Tasks/managingexadatainstances.htm)
Ask your account administrator for the following items to access [Oracle Cloud My Services API](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/itas/latest/):
  * Account credentials:
    * User name and password
    * Identity domain ID
An identity domain ID can be either the _IDCS GUID_ that identifies the identity domain for the users within Identity Cloud Service (IDCS) or the _Identity Domain name_ for a traditional Cloud Account.
  * Required roles assigned to above user name


[To determine your API endpoint](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/MyServices/Tasks/managingexadatainstances.htm)
Insert the identity domain ID provided by the account administrator (<domain>) between `/itas/` and `/myservices/`. 
Example:
Copy
```
https://itra.oraclecloud.com/itas/<domain>/myservices/api/v1/serviceEntitlements
```

## Creating Exadata Instances ðŸ”— 
This section covers how to create a basic Exadata instance, an instance with custom IP network configuration, and an instance with multi-VM support. 
[To create a basic Exadata instance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/MyServices/Tasks/managingexadatainstances.htm)
Post a request with the required payload to create a new instance for a given service entitlement (Exadata in our case).
In the following example, <domain> is the identity domain ID.

#### Attributes
Name | Description  
---|---  
requestPayload. customAttributes. ClientNetwork |  Required: Yes  Type: Url IP network definitions for the network that is primarily used for client access to the database servers. Applications typically access databases on Exadata Cloud Service through this network using Oracle Net Services in conjunction with Single Client Access Name (SCAN) and Oracle RAC Virtual IP (VIP) interfaces.  
requestPayload. customAttributes. BackupNetwork |  Required: Yes  Type: Url IP network definitions for the network that is typically used to access the database servers for various purposes, including backups and bulk data transfers.  
[To create an Exadata instance with multi-VM support](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/MyServices/Tasks/managingexadatainstances.htm)
If your Exadata system environment is enabled to support multiple virtual machine (VM) clusters, then you can define up to eight clusters and specify how the overall Exadata system resources are allocated to them.
In a configuration with multiple VM clusters, each VM cluster is allocated a dedicated portion of the overall Exadata system resources, with no over-provisioning or resource sharing. On the compute nodes, a separate VM is defined for each VM cluster, and each VM is allocated a dedicated portion of the available compute node CPU, memory, and local disk resources. Each VM cluster is also allocated a dedicated portion of the overall Exadata storage.
Post a request with the attributes EXAUNIT_ALLOCATIONS and MULTIVM_ENABLED as part of the payload. The following example includes these optional attributes as well as required attributes. 
In the following example, <domain> is the identity domain ID and <base64_encoded_string> is a base64 encoding of the payload following the example.

{
name:ExaunitID,value:5
},{
name:TotalNumOfCoresForCluster

}
```

  * When doing a Reshape with the `OracleHomeDiskSizeInGb` attribute, use the name `OhomePartitionInGB`.
  * The value for `TotalNumOfCoresForCluster` must be a multiple of `numComputes` as returned by a call to `ecra/endpoint/clustershapes`. 
  * The value for `TotalMemoryInGb` must be a multiple of `numComputes` as returned by a call to `ecra/endpoint/clustershapes`.

## Deleting Exadata Instances ðŸ”— 
This section covers how to delete Exadata instances. 
**Important** Delete all existing multi-VM clusters before deleting the Exadata instance. Following this guidance prevents the instance ending up in an invalid state.

## Discovering Entitlements and Instances ðŸ”— 
This section describes how to discover service entitlements and service instances. 
[To discover service entitlements](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/MyServices/Tasks/managingexadatainstances.htm)
Send the following request:
Copy
```
GET /itas/<domain>/myservices/api/v1/serviceEntitlements?serviceDefinitionNames=Exadata
```

Example payload returned for this request: 
Copy
```
{
  "items": [
   {
    "id": "cesi-585927251",        // Unique ServiceEntitlementId
    "serviceDefinition": {
     "canonicalLink": "/itas/a517289/myservices/api/v1/serviceDefinitions/502579309",
     "id": "502579309",
     "name": "Exadata"         // The customer is entitled to use the Exadata Service
    },
    "status": "ACTIVE",
    ...
    "canonicalLink": "/itas/a517289/myservices/api/v1/serviceInstances/csi-585928949"
   }
  ...                       // More Service Entitlements could be displayed
  ],
 "canonicalLink": "/itas/<domain>/myservices/api/v1/serviceEntitlements",
 "hasMore": false,
 "limit": 25, 
 "offset": 0
}
```

Eligible Data Centers: 
Use:
```
/itas/<domain>/myservices/api/v1/serviceEntitlements/{ServiceEntitlementId}?expands=serviceInstancesEligibleDataCenters
```

where `{ServiceEntitlementId}` is a service entitlement ID such as `cesi-500074601`. This will provide additional information such as: 
Copy
```
 "serviceInstancesEligibleDataCenters": [
  {
   "id": "US001"
  }
 ],
```
