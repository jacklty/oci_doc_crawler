For Big Data Service clusters, we recommend using JCEKS file for storing passwords because they're secure. 
Create a JCEKS provider file for both `OCI_PASSPHRASE_METADATA` and `BDS_OSS_CLIENT_AUTH_PASSPHRASE`. For more information, see [Managing Passphrase through JCEKS](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Chunk557746916.htm#jceks-creating "We recommend using JCEKS file for storing passwords because they're secure.").
**Note** The JCEKS file can be created on a local system or in HDFS.
