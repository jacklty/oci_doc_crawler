# Tagging a Volume Group
Add metadata to a volume group in the Block Volume service.
**Note** If you're not sure whether to apply tags, ask your administrator for guidance.
You can apply tags to volume groups to organize them according to your business needs. Apply tags at the time you create a volume group, or update the volume group with tags later. For more information about applying tags, see [Overview of Tagging](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Tagging/Concepts/taggingoverview.htm).
The following pages describe how you can apply tagging to volume groups:
  * [Tagging a Volume Group at Creation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/Concepts/tag-create-volume-group.htm#top "Add metadata to a volume group when you first create it. This metadata enables you to define keys and values and to associate them with resources.")
  * [Tagging a Volume Group When Updating](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/Concepts/tag-update-volume-group.htm#top "Add metadata to a volume group when you update it. This metadata enables you to define keys and values and to associate them with resources.")
