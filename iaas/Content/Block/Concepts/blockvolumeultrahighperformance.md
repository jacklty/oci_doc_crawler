# Ultra High Performance
The **Ultra High Performance** level is recommended for workloads with the highest I/O requirements, requiring the best possible performance, such as large databases.
This option provides the best linear performance scale with 225 IOPS/GB up to a maximum of 300,000 IOPS per volume. Throughput also scales at the highest rate at 1,800 KB/s/GB up to a maximum of 2,680 MB/s per volume.

To optimize performance for a volume configured for the **Ultra High Performance** level, the volume attachment needs to be enabled for multipath. See [Attaching Ultra High Performance Volumes](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/Tasks/attachingavolume.htm#multipath) and [Checking if a Volume Attachment is Multipath-Enabled](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/Tasks/multipathcheck.htm#multipathcheck "When you attach a volume configured for the Ultra High Performance level, the volume attachment must be enabled for multipath to optimize the volume's performance. This topic describes how to verify if the volume attachment is multipath-enabled.") for more information.
See [Troubleshooting Ultra High Performance Volume Attachments](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/Tasks/troubleshootingmultipathattachments.htm#troubleshootuhp "This topic covers troubleshooting steps you can take as well as prerequisites to verify for volumes configured for the Ultra High Performance level where either the volume fails to attach or the volume attachment is not multipath-enabled.") for steps to take to troubleshoot issues you encounter when attaching a volume configured for the **Ultra High Performance** level.
See [Performance Details for Shapes](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/Concepts/blockvolumeperformance.htm#shapes_block_details) for performance characteristics and instance details for Compute shapes, as well as whether the shape supports multipath-enabled attachments for the **Ultra High Performance** level. 
**Note** When you change the volume performance to **Ultra High Performance** from any other performance level you need to detach and then reattach the volume. See [Detaching a Volume](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/Tasks/detachingavolume.htm#Detaching_a_Volume "Detach a block volume from an instance.") and [Attaching a Block Volume to an Instance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/Tasks/attachingavolume.htm#top "Attach a block volume to a compute instance to expand the available storage on the instance.").
## Boot Volumes and Ultra High Performance ðŸ”— 
Boot volumes for VM instances with paravirtualized attachments support the **Ultra High Performance** level. Boot volumes configured for the **Ultra High Performance** level do not use multipath-enabled attachments, so the details about enabling and troubleshooting multipath-enabled attachments do not apply to boot volumes.
When a boot volume is configured for 120 VPUs/GB, the performance is 225 IOPS/GB. The performance scale factor will follow the VPUs/GB scale, with a maximum performance of 50,000 IOPS. Maximum performance for smaller boot volume sizes will be lower. Consider the following examples:
  * Boot volume sized at 50 GBs, configured for the **Ultra High Performance** level, at 120 VPUs/GB. The maximum performance for this volume is 11,250 IOPS. (50 GB x 225 IOPS/GB = 11,250.) 
  * Boot volume sized at 223 GBs, configured for the **Ultra High Performance** level, at 120 VPUs/GB. The maximum performance for this volume is 50,000 IOPS. (223 GB x 225 IOPS/GB = 50,175, so maximum performance of 50,000 IOPS.) 

The minimum boot volume size to achieve the maximum performance of 50,000 IOPS is 223 GB. You can resize boot volumes, see [Resizing a Volume](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/Tasks/resizingavolume.htm#Resizing_a_Volume) for more information.
**Note** To achieve the maximum of 50,000 IOPS on VM instances, the number of configured OCPUs should be greater than or equal to 8.
## Performance Characteristics ðŸ”— 
The following table lists the performance characteristics for the specified number of volume performance units (VPUs) for the **Ultra High Performance** option.
Volume Performance Units (VPUs) |  IOPS per GB |  Max IOPS per Volume |  Size for Max IOPS (GB) |  KBPS per GB |  Max MBPS per Volume  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
30 | 90 | 75,000 | 833 | 720 | 880  
40 | 105 | 100,000 | 952 | 840 | 1,080  
50 | 120  | 125,000 | 1,042 | 960 | 1,280  
60 | 135 | 150,000 | 1,111 | 1,080 | 1,480  
70 | 150 | 175,000 | 1,167 | 1,200 | 1,680  
80 | 165 | 200,000 | 1,212 | 1,320 | 1,880  
90 | 180 | 225,000 | 1,250 | 1,440 | 2,080  
100 | 195 | 250,000 | 1,282 | 1,560 | 2,280  
110 | 210 | 275,000 | 1,310 | 1,680 | 2,480  
120 | 225 | 300,000 | 1,333 | 1,800 | 2,680  
## Volume Size and Performance ðŸ”— 
The following table lists the Block Volume service's throughput and IOPS performance numbers based on volume size for the **Ultra High Performance** level, at 120 VPUs. IOPS and KB/s performance scales linearly per GB volume size up to the service maximums so you can predictably calculate the performance numbers for a specific volume size. If you're trying to achieve certain performance targets for volumes configured to use the **Ultra High Performance** level you can provision a minimum volume size using this table as a reference.
Volume Size |  Max Throughput (1 MB block size) |  Max Throughput (8 KB block size) |  Max IOPS (4 KB block size)  
---|---|---|---  
50 GB |  90 MB/s |  45 MB/s | 11,500  
100 GB |  180 MB/s | 90 MB/s | 23,000  
200 GB | 360 MB/s | 180 MB/s | 46,000  
400 GB | 720 MB/s | 360 MB/s | 92,000  
600 GB | 1,080 MB/s | 560 MB/s | 138,000  
800 GB | 1,440 MB/s | 760 MB/s | 184,000  
1,024 GB | 1,842 MB/s | 940 MB/s | 235,320  
1,200 GB | 2,160 MB/s | 1,024 MB/s | 276,000  
1,500 GB - 32 TB | 2,680 MB/s | 1,350 MB/s | 300,000
