# Move Block Volume Resources Between Compartments
You can move Block Volume resources such as block volumes, boot volumes, volume backups, volume groups, and volume group backups from one compartment to another. When you move a Block Volume resource to a new compartment, associated resources are not moved. After you move the resource to the new compartment, inherent policies apply immediately and affect access to the resource through the Console. For more information, see [Managing Compartments](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/compartments/managingcompartments.htm).
**Important** When moving Block Volume resources between compartments you need to ensure that the resource users have sufficient access permissions on the compartment the resource is being moved to.
## Required IAM Policy ðŸ”— 
To use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, you must be granted security access in a **policy** by an administrator. This access is required whether you're using the Console or the REST API with an SDK, CLI, or other tool. If you get a message that you don't have permission or are unauthorized, verify with your administrator what type of access you have and which **compartment** to work in.
For administrators: The following policies allow users to move Block Volume resources to a different compartment:
Copy
```
Allow group BlockCompartmentMovers to manage volume-family in tenancy
```

If you're new to policies, see [Getting Started with Policies](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm) and [Common Policies](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/commonpolicies.htm).
## Security Zones ðŸ”— 
[Security Zones](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/security-zone/home.htm) ensure that your cloud resources comply with Oracle security principles. If any operation on a resource in a security zone compartment violates a [policy for that security zone](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/security-zone/using/security-zone-policies.htm), then the operation is denied.
The following security zone policies affect your ability to move Block Volume resources from one compartment to another:
  * You can't move a block volume or boot volume from a security zone to a compartment that is not in the security zone.
  * You can't move a block volume or boot volume to a compartment that is in a security zone if the volume violates any security zone policies.
