# Policy-Based Backups
The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Block Volume service provides you with the capability to perform volume backups and volume group backups automatically on a schedule and retain them based on the selected backup policy.
With user defined policies, you can also enable scheduled cross-region backups, so that scheduled volume backups are automatically copied to a second region, see [Scheduling Volume Backup Copies Across Regions](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/Tasks/schedulingvolumebackups.htm#CrossRegionCopy).
These features allow you to adhere to your data compliance and regulatory requirements. 
**Caution**
Deleting Block Volumes with Policy-Based Backups 
All policy-based backups will eventually expire, so if you want to keep a volume backup indefinitely, you need to create a [manual backup](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/Concepts/blockvolumebackups.htm#manual), see [Creating a Manual Backup for a Block Volume](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/Tasks/backingupavolume.htm#Backing_Up_a_Volume "Create a manual backup for a volume in the Block Volume service.").
Volume backups are point-in-time snapshots of volume data. For more information about volume backups, see [Overview of Block Volume Backups](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/Concepts/blockvolumebackups.htm#Overview_of_Block_Volume_Backups).
There are two kinds of backup policies:
  * **User defined** : Custom backup policies that you create and configure schedules for. 
  * **Oracle defined** : Predefined backup policies that have a set backup frequency and retention period. You cannot modify these policies. 


**Note**
Timing for Scheduled Backups 
Scheduled volume backups are not guaranteed to start at the exact time specified by the backup schedule. You may see up to several hours of delay between the scheduled start time and the actual start time for the volume backup in scenarios where the system is overloaded. This applies to both user defined and Oracle defined backup policies.
## User Defined Backup Policies ðŸ”— 
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure enables you to customize your backup schedules with user defined policies. These are backup policies that you define the backup frequency and retention period for. There are two parts to user defined backup policies, the backup policy itself, and then one or more schedules in the policy.
To get started with user defined backup policies, you need to first create the backup policy, see [To create a user defined backup policy](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/Tasks/schedulingvolumebackups.htm#createcustom). After this step, you have an empty backup policy, so the next step is to define and add schedules to the policy.
### Schedules ðŸ”— 
Schedules define the backup frequency and retention period for a user defined backup policy, just like Oracle defined backup policies. The difference is that you can customize the schedules associated with user defined policies. This gives you control over the backup frequency and retention period.
When defining a schedule for a user defined backup policy, the first thing you configure is the schedule type, this specifies the backup frequency. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure provides the following schedule types:
  * **Daily** : Backups are generated daily. You specify the hour of the day for the backup. 
  * **Weekly** : Backups are generated weekly. You specify the day of the week, and the hour of that day for the backup. 
  * **Monthly** : Backups are generated monthly. You specify the day of the month, and the hour of that day for the backup. 
  * **Yearly** : Backups are generated yearly. You specify the month, the day of that month, and the hour of that day for the backup. 


**Important**
Block Volume runs only one scheduled backup per volume per day. If more than one backup is scheduled for a volume on a particular day, the service runs only one of them, using the following priority:
  1. Yearly
  2. Monthly
  3. Weekly
  4. Daily


In addition to frequency, you also configure the following:
  * **Retention time** : The amount of time to keep the backup, in days, weeks, months, or years. The time period is based the schedule type. 
  * **Backup type** Options are full or incremental, see [Volume Backup Types](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/Concepts/blockvolumebackups.htm#backuptype) for more information. 
  * **Timezone** The time zone to use for the backup schedule. Options are UTC or the regional data center time zone. 


For more information, see [To add a schedule to a user defined backup policy](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/Tasks/schedulingvolumebackups.htm#addsched).
You can also edit or remove schedules for a user defined policy at any time, see [To edit a schedule for a user defined backup policy](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/Tasks/schedulingvolumebackups.htm#editsched) and [To delete a schedule for a user defined backup policy](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/Tasks/schedulingvolumebackups.htm#deletesched).
### Duplicating Existing Backup Policies ðŸ”— 
You can create a new backup policy by duplicating any of the existing backup policies.
If one of the Oracle defined policies is close to meeting your volume backup requirements, but with some changes, you can create a new backup policy by duplicating the Oracle defined policy. This creates a new user defined backup policy with schedules already assigned, enabling you to use the Oracle defined policy's settings as a starting point to save time and simplify the process.
You can also duplicate an existing user defined policy. For more information, see [To duplicate a backup policy](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/Tasks/schedulingvolumebackups.htm#duppol). You can then add, edit, or delete schedules for the new backup policy.
### Scheduling Volume Backup Copies Across Regions ðŸ”— 
The Block Volume service enables you to copy volume backups from one region to another for business continuity and disaster recovery scenarios, for more information, see [Copying Block Volume Backups Across Regions](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/Concepts/blockvolumebackups.htm#Copying). With user-defined policies, you can automate this process, so that volume backups are copied to another region on a schedule. Enabling the automatic copying of scheduled volume backups is only supported with user-defined policies, so if you need to use this feature for a volume currently configured with an Oracle defined policy, you need to duplicate the policy and then enable cross region copy. The volume backup copy in the target region has the same retention period as the volume backup in the source region.
**Note** Vault encryption keys for volumes aren't copied to the destination region for scheduled volume and volume group backups enabled for cross region copy. Instead, you can specify a Vault encryption key for the backup copied to the destination region when you assign the backup policy. When you assign the backup policy, if it's enabled for cross region backup copies, select **Encrypt using customer-managed keys** for **Cross region backup copy encryption** to encrypt the volume backup in the destination region. If you select this option, you must specify the OCID for a valid encryption key in the destination region, see [Requirements for Customer-Managed Encryption Keys for Cross-Region Operations](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/Concepts/managingblockencryptionkeys.htm#blockvolumeencryption_crossregionkeys) for more information.
**Note** It might take up to 24 hours for daily scheduled volume backups to be copied to the target region. You can verify that the volume backup was copied by switching to the target region and checking the list of volume backups for that region. If the volume backup hasn't been copied yet, you can perform a manual copy of that volume backup to the target region using the steps described in [Copying a Volume Backup Between Regions](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/Tasks/copyingvolumebackupcrossregion.htm#Copying_a_Volume_Backup_Between_Regions).
#### Cost ðŸ”— 
Once this feature is enabled, your bill will include charges for storing volume backups in both the source region and the destination region. You may also see an increase in network costs. For pricing details, see [Oracle Storage Cloud Pricing](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/storage/pricing.html). The Object Storage price applies to backup storage. Outbound Data Transfer price will be applicable for network costs with cross-region backup copies.
## Oracle Defined Backup Policies ðŸ”— 
There are three Oracle defined backup policies, Bronze, Silver, and Gold. Each backup policy is comprised of schedules with a set backup frequency and a retention period that you cannot modify. If the backup policy settings for Oracle defined policies don't meet your requirements, you should use [User Defined Backup Policies](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/Tasks/schedulingvolumebackups.htm#custom) instead. With user defined backup policies you define and control the schedules. You can also enable the automatic copying of volume backups to a second region, which is not supported with Oracle defined policies.
**Note** Oracle defined backup policies are not supported for scheduled volume group backups.
**Caution**
Full Backups and Oracle Defined Policies
As of November 3, 2021, Oracle defined policies no longer include full backups. See [Full backups removed from Oracle defined backup policies](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/servicechanges.htm#servicechanges_topic-Full_backups_removed_from_Oracle_defined_policies). Incremental backups are functionally the same as full backups for data recovery purposes. Some compliance scenarios may require scheduled full backups. For these compliance scenarios, configure a user defined backup policy instead. You can create a new user defined policy from an existing backup policy, see [Duplicating Existing Backup Policies](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/Tasks/schedulingvolumebackups.htm#duplicatepolicy).
### Bronze Policy
The bronze policy includes monthly incremental backups, run on the first day of the month. These backups are retained for twelve months. This policy also includes an incremental backup, run yearly during the first part of January. This backup is retained for five years.
### Silver Policy
The silver policy includes weekly incremental backups that run on Sunday. These backups are retained for four weeks. This policy also includes monthly incremental backups, run on the first day of the month and are retained for twelve months. Also includes an incremental backup, run yearly during the first part of January. This backup is retained for five years.
### Gold Policy
The gold policy includes daily incremental backups, retained for seven days, along with weekly incremental backups, run on Sunday and retained for four weeks. Includes monthly incremental backups, run on the first day of the month, retained for twelve months. Also includes an incremental backup, run yearly during the first part of January. This backup is retained for five years.
## Working with Backup Policies ðŸ”— 
There are two types of tasks when working with backup policies:
  * [Creating and Configuring User Defined Backup Policies](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/Tasks/schedulingvolumebackups.htm#configPolicies)
  * [Managing Backup Policy Assignments to Volumes](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/Tasks/schedulingvolumebackups.htm#assignPolicies)


The linked sections listed above provide information for working with backup policies using the Console, CLI, and REST APIs.
### Required IAM Policy
To use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, you must be granted security access in a **policy** by an administrator. This access is required whether you're using the Console or the REST API with an SDK, CLI, or other tool. If you get a message that you don't have permission or are unauthorized, verify with your administrator what type of access you have and which **compartment** to work in.
**Important** To view or work with backup policies, you need access to the root compartment, which is where the predefined backup policies are located.
For administrators: The policy in [Let volume admins manage block volumes, backups, and volume groups](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/commonpolicies.htm#volume-admins-manage-volumes-and-backups) lets the specified group do everything with block volumes and backups. The policy in [Let volume backup admins manage only backups](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/commonpolicies.htm#volume-backup-admins-manage-only-backups) further restricts access to just creating and managing backups.
**Tip** When users create a backup from a volume or restore a volume from a backup, the volume and backup don't have to be in the same **compartment**. However, users must have access to both compartments. 
If you're new to policies, see [Getting Started with Policies](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm) and [Common Policies](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/commonpolicies.htm). For reference material about writing policies for instances, cloud networks, or other Core Services API resources, see [Details for the Core Services](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/policyreference/corepolicyreference.htm).
### Tagging Resources ðŸ”— 
You can apply tags to your resources to help you organize them according to your business needs. You can update the resource later with the desired tags. For general information about applying tags, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).
## Creating and Configuring User Defined Backup Policies ðŸ”— 
### Using the Console ðŸ”— 
You can use the Console to create and update user defined backup policies.

  3. Specify a name for the backup policy. Avoid entering confidential information.
  4. Select the compartment to create the backup policy in.
While you select a compartment for the backup policy, it's accessible across your tenancy.
  5. Optionally, you can enable cross region copy to the specified region. This automates the copying of the volume backup to a second region after each backup is created. To enable cross region copy, select a target region from the **Cross Region Copy Target** list. This is the region the volume backup will be copied to. For more information, see [Scheduling Volume Backup Copies Across Regions](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/Tasks/schedulingvolumebackups.htm#CrossRegionCopy).
When you assign a backup policy with cross region copy enabled to a volume, you can optionally select **Encrypt using customer-managed keys** for **Cross region backup copy encryption** to encrypt the volume backup with a Vault key from the destination region. See [Specifying a Key for Cross-Region Backup Copies](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/Concepts/managingblockencryptionkeys.htm#updatebackupkey__xrrbackupkeys) for more information.

## Tracking the Status of Backup Operations with Events ðŸ”— 
You can use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Events to track the status of Block Volume backup operations. See [Block Volume Events](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Events/Reference/eventsproducers.htm#blockevents__block_volume) for a list of these event types. All Block Volume event types include a **status** attribute. The **status** attribute value is either **operationFailed** or **operationSucceed** , depending on the whether the backup operation succeeded or failed. 
**Note** You need to manually type the **operationFailed** and **operationSucceed** attribute values into the text box when creating a rule in the Console.
For a walkthrough of how to use the **Create Volume Backup End** event's **status** attribute to notify you when a scheduled volume backup fails, see [Using Events to Notify When a Volume Backup Fails](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/Tasks/backupstatusevents.htm#backupstatusevents).
