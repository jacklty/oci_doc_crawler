# Connecting to a Block Volume
Connect to a block volume that's attached to a compute instance. 
To connect to a volume, you must first attach the volume to the instance. See [Attaching a Block Volume to an Instance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/Tasks/attachingavolume.htm#top "Attach a block volume to a compute instance to expand the available storage on the instance."). The steps to connect depend on the volume attachment type, paravirtualized or iSCSI. For more information about attachment type options, see [Volume Attachment Types](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/Concepts/overview.htm#attachtype).
## Paravirtualized-Attached Volumes ðŸ”— 
For volumes attached with [Paravirtualized](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/Concepts/overview.htm#Paravirtualized) as the volume attachment type, you don't need to perform any additional steps after attaching the volumes; they're connected automatically. However, for Linux-based images, if you want to mount these volumes when the instance starts, you need to perform additional configuration steps:
  * If you specified a device path when you attached the volume, see [fstab Options for Block Volumes Using Consistent Device Paths](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/References/fstaboptionsconsistentdevicepaths.htm#fstab_Options_for_Block_Volumes_Using_Consistent_Device_Paths). 
  * If you didn't specify a device path or if the instance was created from an image that doesn't support device paths, see [Traditional fstab Options](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/References/fstaboptions.htm#Traditional_fstab_Options)


## iSCSI-Attached Volumes ðŸ”— 
For volumes attached with [iSCSI](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/Concepts/overview.htm#iSCSI) as the volume attachment type, you need to connect and mount the volume from the instance for the volume to be usable. See [Connecting to iSCSI-Attached Block Volumes](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/Tasks/connectingtoavolume_topic-Connecting_to_iSCSIAttached_Volumes.htm#top "Connect to an iSCSI-attached block volume."). 
**Important** When you attach a volume using an iSCSI attachment type, you can optionally specify that the Block Volume Management plugin should run the iSCSI commands to connect to the volume. See step 9 in [Attaching a Volume](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/Tasks/attachingavolume.htm#console). If you select this option, you don't need to perform the steps to connect to and log in to iSCSI for the volume on the instance.
