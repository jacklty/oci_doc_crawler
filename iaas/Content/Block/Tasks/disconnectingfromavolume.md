# Disconnecting From a Volume
For volumes attached with [iSCSI](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/Concepts/overview.htm#iSCSI) as the volume attachment type you need to disconnect the volume from an instance before you detach the volume. For more information about attachment type options, see [Volume Attachment Types](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/Concepts/overview.htm#attachtype).
## Required IAM Policy ðŸ”— 
Disconnecting a volume from an instance does not require a specific IAM policy. Don't confuse this with detaching a volume (see [Detaching a Volume](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/Tasks/detachingavolume.htm#Detaching_a_Volume "Detach a block volume from an instance.")).

**Caution** We recommend that you unmount and disconnect the volume from the instance using `iscsiadm` before you detach the volume. Failure to do so may lead to loss of data.
  1. Log on to your instance's guest OS and unmount the volume.
  2. Run the following command to disconnect the instance from the volume:
Copy
```
iscsiadm -m node -T <IQN> -p <iSCSIÂ IPÂ ADDRESS>:<iSCSIÂ PORT> -u
```

A successful logout response resembles the following:
```
Logging out of session [sid: 2, target: iqn.2015-12.us.oracle.com:c6acda73-90b4-4bbb-9a75-faux09015418, portal: 169.254.0.2,3260]
Logout of [sid: 2, target: iqn.2015-12.us.oracle.com:c6acda73-90b4-4bbb-9a75-faux09015418, portal: 169.254.0.2,3260] successful.
```

  3. You can now detach the volume without the risk of losing data.
