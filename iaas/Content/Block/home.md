#### Common Tasks
[Learn about volume groups](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/Concepts/volumegroups.htm#Volume_Groups "The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Block Volume service provides you with the capability to group together many volumes in a volume group. A volume group can include both types of volumes, boot volumes, which are the system disks for your compute instances, and block volumes for your data storage. You can use volume groups to create volume group backups and clones that are point-in-time and crash-consistent.")
[Replicate a volume](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/Concepts/volumereplication.htm#volumereplication "The Block Volume service provides you with the capability to perform ongoing automatic asynchronous replication of block volumes, boot volumes, and volume groups to other regions and availability domains.")
