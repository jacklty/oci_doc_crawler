# Boot Volume Metrics
You can monitor the health, capacity, and performance of your Compute instances by using [metrics](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Concepts/monitoringoverview.htm#metrics), [alarms](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Concepts/monitoringoverview.htm#alarms), and [notifications](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Notification/home.htm). 
The Block Volume service provides a set of metrics that apply to both boot volumes and block volumes. For more information, see [Block Volume Metrics](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/References/volumemetrics.htm#Block_Volume_Metrics).
