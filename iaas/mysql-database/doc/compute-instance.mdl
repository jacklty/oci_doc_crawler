## Compute Instance ðŸ”— 
You cannot connect directly from a remote IP to the endpoint of a DB system. Use SSH or RDP to connect to a compute instance, and from the compute instance use MySQL Shell, MySQL Client or MySQL Workbench to connect to the DB system.
  * [Connecting to a Compute Instance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/mysql-database/doc/compute-instance.html#GUID-7CC4A323-51D7-4E30-B519-293CE829EC39 "Use SSH or RDP, depending on the platform, to connect to a compute instance.")
  * [Connecting to a DB System](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/mysql-database/doc/compute-instance.html#GUID-FF6434EE-524B-4FB5-8166-6A93A80CCF3B "Use MySQL Shell, MySQL Client, or MySQL Workbench from a compute instance to connect to a DB system.")


### Connecting to a Compute Instance ðŸ”— 
Use SSH or RDP, depending on the platform, to connect to a compute instance.
#### Using the CLI ðŸ”— 
Use the command-line interface to connect to a compute instance.
This task requires the following: 
  * A running VCN with internet connectivity. See [Creating a Virtual Cloud Network](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/mysql-database/doc/creating-virtual-cloud-network.html#GUID-A5D4A49C-53AD-4A6B-978A-5A7435E73762 "Create a virtual cloud network \(VCN\) that adheres to the security rules and IP address requirements."). 
  * A running MySQL DB system attached to the VCN. Note the IP address of the MySQL endpoint in the DB system, and the administrator username and password. To find the IP Address, see [Resource: Endpoints](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/mysql-database/doc/viewing-db-system-details.html#GUID-06F1A98D-2541-4868-B0B8-B2C7601BA741 "The Endpoints resource on the DB system details page shows the details and current state of the DB system's read/write endpoint, which clients and connectors can use to connect to the MySQL instance."). 
  * A running compute instance (Oracle Linux is used in the task) attached to a public subnet on the same VCN as the MySQL DB system. Note the public IP address of the compute instance. The SSH port, 22, is added to the public subnet by default. It is recommended you add an ingress rule for port 33060, which is the default port for MySQL Shell. If that port is not available, MySQL Shell connects to port 3306. If you have configured alternative ports, include the port number in your connection string. See [Overview of Networking](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/mysql-database/doc/overview-networking.html#GUID-374E351D-8D4C-431B-8C03-CEED86814F81 "MySQL DB system endpoints are not public. To connect to a DB system, create a virtual cloud network \(VCN\) and add ingress rules. You can then use a compute instance, a Bastion session, or a VPN connection to connect to the DB system."). 


  1. Set the file permissions so that only you can read the file:
```
chmod 400 <PrivateKeyFile>
```

<PrivateKeyFile>: Specify the full path and name of the file that contains the private key associated with the instance you want to access. 
  2. SSH into the compute instance from your local machine using the public IP address of the compute instance.
```
ssh -i <PrivateKeyFile> <Username>@<ComputePublicIpAddress>
```

     * <PrivateKeyFile>: Specify the full path and name of the file that contains the private key associated with the instance you want to access. 
     * <Username>: Specify the default username for the instance. For Oracle Linux and CentOS images, the default username is `opc`. For Ubuntu images, the default username is `ubuntu`. 
     * <ComputePublicIpAddress>: Specify the IP address of the instance that you retrieved from the Console. 


You are now connected to the compute instance.

### Connecting to a DB System ðŸ”— 
Use MySQL Shell, MySQL Client, or MySQL Workbench from a compute instance to connect to a DB system.
  * [Using MySQL Shell](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/mysql-database/doc/compute-instance.html#GUID-70023ABD-5418-4C1F-975F-F3E2ABC0F93E "Use MySQL Shell on a compute instance to connect to the endpoint of the DB system.")
  * [Using MySQL Client](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/mysql-database/doc/compute-instance.html#GUID-1AEF626B-F504-4F04-8721-65E4BC35FED7 "Use MySQL Client on a compute instance to connect to the endpoint of the DB system.")

#### Using MySQL Shell ðŸ”— 
Use MySQL Shell on a compute instance to connect to the endpoint of the DB system. 
This task requires the following: 
  * A running VCN with internet connectivity. See [Creating a Virtual Cloud Network](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/mysql-database/doc/creating-virtual-cloud-network.html#GUID-A5D4A49C-53AD-4A6B-978A-5A7435E73762 "Create a virtual cloud network \(VCN\) that adheres to the security rules and IP address requirements."). 
  * A running MySQL DB system attached to the VCN. Note the IP address of the MySQL endpoint in the DB system, and the administrator username and password. To find the IP Address, see [Resource: Endpoints](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/mysql-database/doc/viewing-db-system-details.html#GUID-06F1A98D-2541-4868-B0B8-B2C7601BA741 "The Endpoints resource on the DB system details page shows the details and current state of the DB system's read/write endpoint, which clients and connectors can use to connect to the MySQL instance."). 
  * A running and connected compute instance (Oracle Linux is used in the task) attached to a public subnet on the same VCN as the MySQL DB system. Note the public IP address of the compute instance. The SSH port, 22, is added to the public subnet by default. It is recommended you add an ingress rule for port 33060, which is the default port for MySQL Shell. If that port is not available, MySQL Shell connects to port 3306. If you have configured alternative ports, include the port number in your connection string.

To connect to a DB system, create a virtual cloud network \(VCN\) and add ingress rules. You can then use a compute instance, a Bastion session, or a VPN connection to connect to the DB system."). 


Do the following to connect to the DB system:
  1. Install MySQL Shell on the compute instance using the following command:
```
sudo yum install mysql-shell
```

See [Installing MySQL Shell on Linux](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-shell-install-linux-quick.html). 
  2. Start MySQL Shell and connect to the endpoint of the DB system using the following command:
```
mysqlsh <Username>@<DBSystemEndpointIPAddress> 
```

  3. Enter your password when you get the following response:
```
Please provide the password for <DBSystemEndpointIPAddress>:
```

This command starts a global session. By default, MySQL Shell attempts to connect to port 33060, and if the port is not available, it connects to port 3306. 


#### Using MySQL Client ðŸ”— 
Use MySQL Client on a compute instance to connect to the endpoint of the DB system. 
This task requires the following: 
  * A running VCN with internet connectivity. See [Creating a Virtual Cloud Network](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/mysql-database/doc/creating-virtual-cloud-network.html#GUID-A5D4A49C-53AD-4A6B-978A-5A7435E73762 "Create a virtual cloud network \(VCN\) that adheres to the security rules and IP address requirements."). 
  * A running MySQL DB system attached to the VCN. Note the IP address of the MySQL endpoint in the DB system, and the administrator username and password. To find the IP Address, see [Resource: Endpoints](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/mysql-database/doc/viewing-db-system-details.html#GUID-06F1A98D-2541-4868-B0B8-B2C7601BA741 "The Endpoints resource on the DB system details page shows the details and current state of the DB system's read/write endpoint, which clients and connectors can use to connect to the MySQL instance."). 
  * A running and connected compute instance (Oracle Linux is used in the task) attached to a public subnet on the same VCN as the MySQL DB system. Note the public IP address of the compute instance. The SSH port, 22, is added to the public subnet by default. See [Overview of Networking](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/mysql-database/doc/overview-networking.html#GUID-374E351D-8D4C-431B-8C03-CEED86814F81 "MySQL DB system endpoints are not public. To connect to a DB system, create a virtual cloud network \(VCN\) and add ingress rules. You can then use a compute instance, a Bastion session, or a VPN connection to connect to the DB system."). 


Do the following to connect to the DB system:

```
sudo yum install mysql
```

  2. Connect to your DB system using the MySQL Client.
```

```

  3. Enter your password when you get the following response:
