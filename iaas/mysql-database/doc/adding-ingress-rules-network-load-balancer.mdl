## Adding Ingress Rules for a Network Load Balancer ðŸ”— 
If you are connecting to a DB system using a network load balancer, that is, using a public IP address, add ingress rules to the default security list of the public subnet.
### Using the Console ðŸ”— 
Use the Console to add ingress rules to a virtual cloud network (VCN) for a network load balancer to allow traffic from authorized IP addresses.
This task requires the following: 
  * A properly configured VCN. See [Creating a Virtual Cloud Network](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/mysql-database/doc/creating-virtual-cloud-network.html#GUID-A5D4A49C-53AD-4A6B-978A-5A7435E73762 "Create a virtual cloud network \(VCN\) that adheres to the security rules and IP address requirements."). 


Do the following to add ingres rules:
  1. Open the navigation menu, select **Networking,** and then select **Virtual cloud networks**.
  2. Select the compartment from the **List scope**.
  3. From the list of VCNs, click the name of the VCN to open the **Virtual cloud network details** page. 
  4. In the **Virtual cloud network details** page, select **Security lists** from the **Resources** section.
  5. From the list of security lists, click **Default security list for <VCN>**. 
  6. In the **Security list details** page, click **Add ingress rules**.
  7. In the **Add ingress rules** dialog box, provide the following information:
     * **Stateless** : Do not select. 
     * **Source type** : Select **CIDR**. 
     * **Source CIDR** : Specify the CIDR of the network load balancer. If required, you can narrow down the range to more specific IP addresses. For example: 
       * 10.0.0.0/8: Allows traffic from 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 IP addresses, that is, a total of 16,777,216 IP addresses.
       * 10.0.0.0/16: Allows traffic from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.255.255 IP addresses, that is, a total of 65,536 IP addresses.
       * 10.0.0.0/24: Allows traffic from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.0.255 IP addresses, that is, a total of 256 IP addresses.
       * 10.0.2.24/32: Allows traffic from 10.0.2.24 IP address only.
     * **IP protocol:** Select TCP. 
     * **Source port range** : Leave it blank. 
     * **Destination port range** : Specify the port to which the DB system listens, `3306,33060`. 
     * **Description** : Add a descriptive string for the ingress rules. 
  8. Click **Add ingress rules**.


The ingress rule is added to the security list of the public subnet.
